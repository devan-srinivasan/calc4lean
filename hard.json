Note that the functions, between the graphs of which we need to find the distance, are inverses of each other, and their graphs are symmetric with respect to the line $y=x$, and, moreover, are on opposite sides of it.\n\nIf we find a point $A$ on the graph of the function $y=e^{3 x+7}$ that is closest to the line $y=\\mathfrak{z}$, then the point $A^{\\prime}$, symmetric to it, will obviously be the closest to this line on the graph of the function $y=(\\ln x-7) / 3$. If we draw lines through these points parallel to the line $y=x$, the graphs of both functions will be outside the strip bounded by these lines, meaning that the distance between any two points on these graphs is not less than the distance between these lines. On the other hand, the distance between these lines is equal to the distance between the points $A$ and $A^{\\prime}$, so $A A^{\\prime}$ is the desired distance.\n\nLet the coordinates of point $A$ be $\\left(x ; e^{3 x+7}\\right)$, then $A^{\\prime}$ has coordinates $\\left(e^{3 x+7} ; x\\right)$ and the distance between them\n\n$$\n\\rho(x)=\\sqrt{\\left(x-e^{3 x+7}\\right)^{2}+\\left(e^{3 x+7}-x\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{2\\left(e^{3 x+7}-x\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{2}\\left|e^{3 x+7}-x\\right|\n$$\n\nConsider the function $f(x)=e^{3 x+7}-x$ and find its minimum using the derivative: $f^{\\prime}(x)=$ $3 e^{3 x+7}-1$.

Then the lines $KC_1$ and $KA_1$ are tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $A_1BC_1$, since the angles marked in the same way on the left diagram are equal. By the condition, point $M$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $A_1BC_1$. Therefore, $(b/2)^2=KC_1^2=KM \\cdot KB=m/3 \\cdot m$, since point $M$ divides the median $BK$ in the ratio $2:1$. Hence, $m=\\sqrt{3}b/2$, and for a fixed $b$, point $B$ lies on the circle with center $K$ and radius $\\sqrt{3}b/2$. In one of the positions, we get point $B'$ - the vertex of the equilateral triangle $AB'C$. We obtain the picture shown on the right diagram.\n\nPoint $B$ lies on the arc $B_1B_2$ of the larger circle, since triangle $ABC$ is acute-angled. The angle $B$ changes within a fairly small range: from $\\operatorname{arctg} \\sqrt{2}$, not including (this is the smallest value corresponding to points $B_1$ and $B_2$ and the right triangle $ABC$ with legs $b$ and $b/\\sqrt{2}$), to $60^\\circ$ (this is the largest value of angle $B$, since the two circles on the right diagram touch internally, and therefore $\\angle ABC < \\angle AB'C$ for $B \\neq B'$). Due to the continuity of angle $ABC$ as point $B$ moves along the arc $B'B_2$, any intermediate value from the interval $(\\operatorname{arctg} \\sqrt{2}; 60^\\circ)$ corresponds to some position $B''$ of point $B$. For the constructed triangle $AB''C$, point $M$ will lie on the circumcircle of triangle $A_1BC_1$, since the relation $KC_1^2=KM \\cdot KB$ will be satisfied.\n\nComment. The relation $(b/2)^2=m^2/3$ can also be obtained in another way. If $D$ is the point symmetric to $B$ with respect to point $K$, then $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, so $\\angle DAH=\\angle DCH=90^\\circ$, and, moreover, $\\angle DMH=180^\\circ-\\angle BMH=90^\\circ$.

It is known that while Vasya was descending, they were at the same height exactly 4 times, including the moment when Vasya landed and the Ferris wheel cabin was at the bottom. Considering Vasya and Misha as points, find the rate of change of Misha's height at the moment they first reached the same height.\n\nThis problem allows for an intuitive solution based on the consideration of the graphs of the height changes of Misha and Vasya.\n\nThe graph of the height change of Vasya is a straight line $L$, and that of Misha is a sine wave (see Fig. 14). At the moment of Vasya's landing, the sine wave touches the $t$-axis, so \"to the left\" of the landing moment, the line $L$ is \"above\" the sine wave. Moving along $L$ to the left, if the next common point with the sine wave is a point of tangency, there will be no more common points (see Fig. 15). If not, then $L$ will be below the sine wave, and after the next common point, it will be above again. There is one common point left, so it is a point of tangency, and the rate of change of Misha's height at this moment is equal to the rate of change of Vasya's height, which is $3 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{c}$.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_562c0940e9bf5ec7656bg-23.jpg?height=316&width=1026&top_left_y=822&top_left_x=212)\n\nFig. 14\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_562c0940e9bf5ec7656bg-23.jpg?height=308&width=583&top_left_y=1196&top_left_x=442)\n\nFig. 15",

        "llm_response": "This problem involves showing that there are exactly four points where the heights of Vasya and Misha are the same as Vasya descends and Misha moves along a sine wave. To address this, properties of the sine function and possibly some analysis of extremum points are considered, which moves into verifying continuity and the nature of intersections between the two height functions over intervals.\n\nThe statement includes a requirement to show a certain behavior of the functions involved (the straight line and sine wave) rather than just computing derivatives. Moreover, it requires proving properties about intersections, tangents, and rates of change. These elements indicate the need for a more rigorous argument that might involve proving properties of the functions rather than simply executing calculations.\n\nGiven that it also calls for evidence of a specific number of solutions (intersections), and any proof would need to be sufficiently formal to justify these intersections and behavioral properties, it fits into a category of requiring significant proving effort.\n\nTherefore, this problem can be classified as:\n\n**HARD**",

            "solution": "39. a) Let's denote by $\\alpha$ the angle between the course of ship $K_{1}$ and (constant) course of ship $K_{2}$ at some moment in time $t$; it is clear that the angle $\\alpha$ will change over time. At the moment $t$, ship $K_{1}$ is approaching $K_{2}$ at a speed $v$; as for ship $K_{2}$, it is moving away from $K_{1}$ in the direction $K_{1} K_{2}$ at a speed $v \\cos \\alpha$ (this is the projection of the speed $\\overline{K_{2} T_{2}}$ of ship $K_{2}$ onto the direction $K_{1} K_{2}$; see Fig. 101); thus, the approach of the ships at the moment $t$ occurs at a speed $v - v \\cos \\alpha = v(1 - \\cos \\alpha)$, and as time goes on, as the angle $\\alpha$ decreases, the speed of approach of the ships becomes smaller. Note now that the projection $P$ of ship $K_{1}$ onto the path $i$ of ship $K_{2}$ \"chases\" ship $K_{2}$ at a speed $v \\cos \\alpha$ (this is the projection of the speed $\\overline{K_{1} T_{1}}$ of ship $K_{1}$ onto the direction of the line $l$); ship $K_{2}$, on the other hand, moves away from point $P$ at a speed $K_{2} T_{2} = \\nu$. Thus, the segment $P K_{2}$ increases at the same speed $v - v \\cos \\alpha = v(1 - \\cos \\alpha)$ at which the distance between the ships decreases, from which it follows that the sum $K_{1} K_{2} + P K_{2}$ remains constant at all times - it is equal to $d$, since $d$ is equal to this sum at the initial moment (Fig. 8). The closer ship $K_{1}$ approaches the line $l$, the closer in magnitude the segments $K_{1} K_{2}$ and $P K_{2}$ become (with $K_{1} K_{2}$ always being greater than $P K_{2}$). Thus, the distance $K_{1} K_{2}$ always remains greater than $d/2$; however, with the increase of $t$, it approaches $d/2$ indefinitely.\n\nb) Let $K_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $K_{2}^{\\prime}$ be the positions of the ships at the moment when the distance between them reaches the smallest possible value (Fig. $102, a$). It is clear that ship $K_{1}$ has arrived at point $K_{1}^{\\prime}$ along a straight path $K_{1} K_{1}^{\\prime}$: otherwise, it could have shortened the travel time by moving along the segment $K_{1} K_{1}^{\\prime}$. Moreover, it is natural to assume that ship $K_{1}$ arrives at point $K_{1}^{\\prime}$ along the line $K_{1}^{\\prime} K_{2}^{\\prime}$, since if this were not the case, the captain of ship $K_{1}$ could have, by choosing the route $K_{1} K_{2}^{\\prime}$ from the beginning, approached $K_{2}^{\\prime}$ closer than it actually happened (see Fig. $102, \\sigma$, where $K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{\\prime \\prime} = K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{\\prime}$,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-128.jpg?height=396&width=441&top_left_y=922&top_left_x=604)\n\nFig. 101. and point $K_{1}^{\\prime \\prime}$ is closer to $K_{2}^{\\prime}$ than point $K_{1}^{\\prime}$).\n\nLet the angle between the lines $K_{1} K_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $K_{2} K_{2}^{\\prime} = l$ be denoted by $\\alpha$; if the angle between the lines $K_{1} K_{2}$ and $l$ is $\\alpha^{\\prime}$, where $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ are the positions of the ships at some moment in time $t$, then the speed $u \\cos (\\alpha^{\\prime} - \\alpha)$, at which ship $K_{1}$ approaches the second ship at the moment $t$, must be greater than the speed $v \\cos \\alpha^{\\prime}$, at which $K_{2}$ moves away from $K_{1}$ at the same moment, and this must be true at any moment in time before the moment $t_{0}$ when the ships arrive at points $K_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $K_{2}^{\\prime}$ (the ships are approaching); it must be equal to the speed $v \\cos \\alpha^{\\prime}$ at the moment $t_{0}$, when $\\alpha^{\\prime} = \\alpha$ (the ships stop approaching); finally, the speed $u \\cos (\\alpha - \\alpha^{\\prime})$ must be less than the speed $v \\cos \\alpha^{\\prime}$ at the moment $t$ following $t_{0}$ (the ships start moving away from each other).\n\nFrom this we obtain (Fig. $102, a$):\n\n$$\nu = v \\cos \\alpha, \\quad \\text{i.e.} \\quad \\cos \\alpha = \\frac{u}{v}\n$$\n\nwhich determines the course that the captain of ship $K_{1}$ should choose.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-129.jpg?height=44&width=990&top_left_y=271&top_left_x=211)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-129.jpg?height=360&width=456&top_left_y=329&top_left_x=223)\na)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_15011fcc7946713185f0g-129.jpg?height=373&width=486&top_left_y=330&top_left_x=700)\nb)\n\nFig. 102.\n\nIf the ships $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ have traveled the same amount of time, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{\\prime}}{u} = \\frac{K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{\\prime}}{v}, \\text{ i.e. } K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{\\prime} = K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\frac{u}{v} = K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{\\prime} \\cos \\alpha\n$$\n\nAnd since, obviously, $K_{1}^{0} K_{2}^{\\prime} = \\frac{d}{\\sin \\alpha}$ and $K_{2}^{0} K_{2}^{\\prime} = d \\operatorname{ctg} \\alpha$, we finally obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& K_{1}^{\\prime} K_{2}^{\\prime} = K_{1}^{0} K_{2}^{\\prime} - K_{1}^{0} K_{1}^{\\prime} = \\frac{d}{\\sin \\alpha} - d \\operatorname{ctg} \\alpha \\cdot \\cos \\alpha = \\frac{d}{\\sin \\alpha} (1 - \\cos^2 \\alpha) = \\\\\n& = d \\sin \\alpha = d \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \\alpha} = d \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)^2} = \\frac{d \\sqrt{v^2 - u^2}}{v}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

            "solution": "4. We will prove by induction (see fact 24) that any segment can be divided into white and black segments such that the integrals of any polynomial of degree not higher than $n$ over the black and white segments are equal.\n\nBase of induction $(n=0)$: a polynomial of degree zero is a constant. The integral of a constant over any segment is equal to the product of this constant and the length of the segment. Therefore, it is sufficient to divide the segment in half.\n\nInductive step. Consider the segment $[a ; b]$. Let $c$ be its midpoint. By the inductive hypothesis, the segment $[a ; c]$ can be divided into white and black segments such that the integrals of any polynomial of degree not higher than $n-1$ over the black and white segments are equal. Denote the black segments by $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{r}$, and the white segments by $-W_{1}, \\ldots, W_{s}$. The integral of the function $f(x)$ over the segment $B_{i}$ will be denoted by\n\n$$\n\\int_{B_{i}} f(x) d x\n$$\n\nSimilarly, denote the integral of $f(x)$ over $W_{i}$. Translate the segment $B_{i}$ by $c$ to the right and paint the resulting segment white. Denote it by $W_{s+i}$. Similarly, translate the segment $W_{i}$ by $c$ to the right and paint the resulting segment $B_{r+i}$ black. It is clear that the segments $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{r+s}$ and $W_{1}, \\ldots, W_{r+s}$ form a partition of the segment $[a ; b]$. The cases $n=1$ and $n=2$ are illustrated in Fig. 68. We claim that the resulting partition\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_6455f48598646f41a890g-167.jpg?height=109&width=874&top_left_y=549&top_left_x=253)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\begin{array}{cccccccc}\nB_{1} & W_{1} & W_{2} & B_{2} & W_{3} & B_{3} & B_{4} & W_{4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_6455f48598646f41a890g-167.jpg?height=81&width=870&top_left_y=702&top_left_x=251)\n\nhas the required property for all polynomials of degree not higher than $n$. To prove this, note first that\n\n$$\n\\int_{W_{r+i}} f(x) d x=\\int_{B_{i}} f(y+c) d y\n$$\n\nThis equality follows from the change of variables (see fact 28):\n\n$$\ny=x-c, \\quad d y=d x\n$$\n\nUsing the fact that the integral of the difference of functions is the difference of the integrals, rewrite the equality as:\n\n$$\n\\int_{W_{r+i}} f(x) d x-\\int_{B_{i}} f(x) d x=\\int_{B_{i}}(f(x+c)-f(x)) d x .\n$$\n\nAn analogous equality, of course, holds for the segments $W_{i}$ and $B_{s+i}$. Adding all such equalities, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\sum_{i=1}^{r+s} \\int_{W_{i}} f(x) d x-\\sum_{i=1}^{r+s} \\int_{B_{i}} f(x) d x= \\\\\n& \\quad=\\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\int_{B_{i}}(f(x+c)-f(x)) d x-\\sum_{i=1}^{s} \\int_{W_{i}}(f(x+c)-f(x)) d x .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree not higher than $n$, then $f(x+c)-f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree not higher than $n-1$ (see fact 22), so, by the inductive hypothesis, the right-hand side of the last equality is zero. Therefore, the left-hand side is also zero, and the inductive step is proved.\n\nComments. $1^{\\circ}$. Divide the segment $[-1 ; 1]$ into segments of length $2^{-n-1}$. Mark a segment with a \"+\" if it is painted black, and with a \"-\" if it is painted white. The corresponding sequence of pluses and minuses is the $n$-th term of the Morse sequence:\n\n$+, \\quad+-,+--+, \\quad+--+-++-,+--+-++--++-+--+, \\ldots$\n\n(From a piece $A$ we move to a piece $A A^{\\prime}$, where $A^{\\prime}$ is obtained from $A$ by replacing all signs with their opposites.) The $n$-th term of this sequence can be constructed as follows: for each $k=0, \\ldots, 2^{n}-1$, take the sum of its binary digits (see fact 12) and write a \"+\" or \"-\" at the $n$-th place depending on its parity. In this sequence, no combination of symbols is repeated 3 times in a row.\n\n$2^{\\circ}$. The expression\n\n$$\nD_{c} f(x)=f(x+c)-f(x)\n$$\n\nis called the difference derivative of the function $f$ with step $c$. Difference differentiation was used in pre-computer times to construct tables of various functions, for example, approximating $\\sin x$ by a polynomial of degree $n$, and then filling in the table, in which the $k$-th column contains the $k$-th difference derivative. Since the $n$-th derivative is a constant, the $n$-th column is easy to fill. If the $k$-th column is filled, it is not difficult to fill the $(k-1)$-th column. Thus, using only the operation of addition, one can fill the first column, i.e., obtain a table of sines.",

This means that for $n > k$ the term $x_{n}$ is closer to point $a$ than the nearest end of the given segment. Therefore, all terms with indices greater than $k$ lie outside this segment. Hence, the given segment cannot contain an infinite number of terms of the sequence.\n\nb) For the sequence $1; \\frac{1}{2}; 3; \\frac{1}{4}; \\ldots; n^{(-1)^{n-1}}; \\ldots$, any segment centered at point 0 is a \"feeding ground.\" Indeed, the subsequence composed of terms with even indices $\\frac{1}{2}; \\frac{1}{4}; \\frac{1}{6}; \\ldots; \\frac{1}{2n}; \\ldots$ obviously tends to zero. Therefore, in any segment centered at point 0, there is an infinite number of terms of this subsequence (see the solution to problem 114a)). Hence, this segment is a feeding ground for the original sequence. Now, let's show that no segment not containing point 0 is a feeding ground. Indeed, for the subsequence composed of terms with even indices, this segment is not a feeding ground (see the solution to problem 114a)); for the subsequence composed of terms with odd indices $1; 3; 5; 7; \\ldots$, no segment can be a feeding ground (prove this independently). Therefore, on any segment not containing point 0, there will be only a finite number of terms with even indices and a finite number of terms with odd indices. Hence, on this segment, there is a finite number of terms of the sequence, and thus the segment is not a feeding ground.\n\nThus, the sequence $x_{n} = n^{(-1)^{n-1}}$ and the number 0 satisfy the conditions of problem 114b). However, the number 0 is not a limit of the sequence. Indeed, otherwise, for all terms of the sequence starting from some index, the condition $\\left|x_{n}\\right| < 1$ would hold. However, this inequality does not hold for all terms with odd indices.\n\n3 Remark.

            "problem": "257. a) How many roots does the equation\n\n$$\n\\sin x=\\frac{x}{100} ?\n$$\n\nb) How many roots does the equation\n\n$$\n\\sin x=\\lg x ?\n$$",
            "solution": "257. a) First of all, note that if $x_{0}$ is a root of the equation, then $-x_{0}$ is also a root. Therefore, the number of negative roots is the same as the number of positive roots. Furthermore, the number 0 is a root of the equation. Thus, it is sufficient to find the number of positive roots. Now, let's note that if $\\frac{x}{100}=\\sin x$, then\n\n$$\n|x|=100|\\sin x| \\leqslant 100 \\cdot 1=100\n$$\n\nWe obtain that the root of the equation cannot have an absolute value greater than 100.\n\nDivide the segment of the $O x$ axis from $x=0$ to $x=100$ into segments of length $2 \\pi$ (the last segment may be shorter) and count the number of roots of our equation on each of these segments. Refer to Fig. 29.\n\nOn the first segment (from 0 to $2 \\pi$), there is one positive root (and one root zero), on each subsequent segment, except the last one, there are two roots. To determine the number of roots on the last segment, let's estimate its size: $\\frac{100}{2 \\pi}$ is obviously between 15 and $16\\left(\\frac{100}{15}=6.66 \\ldots>2 \\pi ; \\quad \\frac{100}{16}=6.255>\\pi \\right)$; therefore, on this segment, a complete positive half-wave of the sine wave fits and, thus, there are also two roots on it.\n\nThus, we have $1+14 \\cdot 2+2=31$ positive roots of our equation. There are as many negative roots, and one root is zero.\n\nFinally, the total number of roots is $31 \\cdot 2+1=63$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-282.jpg?height=199&width=908&top_left_y=365&top_left_x=120)\n\nFig. 29.\n\nb) The solution to this problem is analogous to the solution of part a). First of all, it is obvious that if $\\sin x=\\lg x$, then $x \\leqslant 10$ (otherwise, the left side of our equality is no more than 1, while the right side is greater). Since $2 \\cdot 2 \\pi>10$, on the segment of the $O x$ axis from $x=0$ to $x=10$, one complete wave of the sine curve $y=\\sin x$ and part of the next wave fit (Fig. 30). The graph of $y=\\lg x$,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-282.jpg?height=296&width=948&top_left_y=891&top_left_x=85)\n\nFig. 30.\n\nobviously intersects the first wave of the sine curve at one point. Further, since $2 \\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\lg x$ and, thus, the graph of $y=\\lg x$ intersects the first half of the second positive half-wave; since $\\lg x=1>\\sin x$ at the point $x=10$, it must intersect the second half of this half-wave as well. Thus, we conclude that the equation $\\sin x=\\lg x$ has a total of three roots.",

            "problem": "### 3.1.1. Antiderivative Function and Indefinite Integral\n\nIn differential calculus, given a function $F(x)$, one finds its derivative $f(x)=F^{\\prime}(x)$. In practice, it is often necessary to solve the inverse problem: to restore the function $F(x)$, knowing its derivative $f(x)$. In this case, the function $F(x)$ is called the antiderivative of $f(x)$.\n\nDefinition 1. A function $F(x)$ is called an antiderivative of the function $f(x)$ if the derivative of $F(x)$ is equal to $f(x)$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nF^{\\prime}(x)=f(x) \\text { or } d F(x)=f(x) d x .\n$$\n\nExample. Suppose we have the function $f(x)=2 x$. The function $F(x)=x^{2}$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$, because $\\left(x^{2}\\right)^{\\prime}=2 x$. But the function $F(x)=x^{2}+1$ is also an antiderivative of $f(x)$, since $\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)^{\\prime}=2 x$, and generally - any function $F(x)=x^{2}+C$ (where $C$ is an arbitrary constant) is an antiderivative of $f(x)$. Thus, this function has a set of antiderivatives, and it can be shown that any two of them differ by a constant number.\n\nTheorem 1 (on two antiderivatives). If $F_{1}(x)$ and $F_{2}(x)$ are two antiderivatives of the function $f(x)$ on the interval $[a, b]$, then the difference between them is a constant number.\n\nFrom this theorem, it follows that if any antiderivative $F(x)$ of the function $f(x)$ is found on some interval (finite or infinite), then any other antiderivative of this function can be found using the formula\n\n$$\nF(x)=F(x)+C,\n$$\n\nwhere $C=$ const.\n\nDefinition 2. The set of antiderivatives of the function $f(x)$ is called the indefinite integral of the function $f(x)$ and is denoted by the symbol $\\int f(x) d x$. Thus, by definition, we have:\n\n$$\n\\int f(x) d x=F(x)+C\n$$\n\nwhere $F(x)$ is some antiderivative; $C=$ const; $x$ is the independent variable of integration; $f(x)$ is the integrand; $f(x) d x$ is the integrand expression; $\\int$ is the integral sign.\n\nThe operation of finding antiderivatives of a function is called its integration.\n\nGeometric meaning of the indefinite integral. The graph of the antiderivative $F(x)$ is called the integral curve. In the coordinate system $x 0 y$, the graphs of all antiderivatives of a given function represent a family of curves depending on the value of the constant $C$ and obtained from each other by parallel translation along the $0 y$ axis. For the example considered above, we have:\n\n$$\n\\int 2 x d x=x^{2}+C\n$$\n\nThe family of antiderivatives ($x^{2}+C$) is geometrically interpreted as a set of parabolas.\n\nIf one needs to find one from the family of antiderivatives, additional conditions are set to determine the constant $C$. Usually, this is done by setting initial conditions: at the argument value $x=x_{0}$, the function has the value $F\\left(x_{0}\\right)=y_{0}$.\n\nExample. It is required to find that antiderivative of the function $y=2 x$ which takes the value 3 at $x_{0}=1$.",

From the chain of inequalities $(y+z)^{2} \\geqslant 0, y^{2}+2 y z+z^{2} \\geqslant 0,\\left(y^{2}+z^{2}\\right) / 2 \\geqslant|y z|$, we obtain that $f(x, y, z) \\leqslant x^{4}+|x|$ when $y^{2}+z^{2} \\neq 0$ and $f(x, y, z)=x^{4}$ when $y^{2}+z^{2}=0$, therefore, as $P(x, y, z) \\rightarrow P_{2}(0,0,0)$, we get that $f(P) \\rightarrow f\\left(P_{2}\\right)$, since $x \\rightarrow \\mathbf{0}$. Hence, $f(P)$ is continuous at point $P_{2}(0,0,0)$.\n\nIn addition to the concept of a function of several variables being continuous at a point with respect to the set of variables, as given above, the concept of a function of several variables being continuous at a point with respect to one variable is also introduced. The continuity of a function of several variables with respect to one of its variables means the continuity of the specified function of one variable when the values of all other variables are fixed: A strict definition of this concept can be given based on the definition of the partial increment of a function of several variables with respect to one of the variables at a given point.\n\nThe partial increment of a function $(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n})$ with respect to the variable $x_{i}$ at the point $P_{0}\\left(x_{1}^{0}, x_{2}^{0}, \\ldots, x_{n}^{0}\\right)$ is the difference $\\Delta_{x_{i}} f\\left(P_{0}\\right)=f\\left(x_{1}^{0}, x_{2}^{0}, \\ldots, x_{l-1}^{0}, x_{l}^{0}+\\Delta x_{i}, x_{l+1}^{0}, \\ldots, x_{n}^{0}\\right)-$ $-f\\left(x_{1}^{0}, x_{2}^{0}, \\ldots, x_{l-1}^{0}, x_{l}^{0}, x_{l+1}^{0}, \\ldots, x_{n}^{0}\\right)$.\n\nA function $y=f\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ is called continuous at the point $P_{0}\\left(x_{1}^{0}, x_{2}^{0}, \\ldots, x_{n}^{0}\\right)$ with respect to the variable $x_{l}$ if its partial increment at the point $P_{0}$ is an infinitesimal function of $\\Delta x_{l}$, that is, if the condition $\\lim _{\\Delta x_{l} \\rightarrow 0} \\Delta_{x_{l}} f\\left(P_{0}\\right)=$ $=0$ is satisfied. Continuity of a function of several variables at a given point with respect to the set of variables implies continuity of this function at the same point with respect to each of its variables. However, continuity of the function $y=f\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ with respect to each of the variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ at a given point $P_{0}$ does not, in general, imply continuity of this function at the point $P_{0}$ (i.e., with respect to the set of variables). This is confirmed by the following example.",

Derivative and Differential\n\nThe derivative of a function $y=f(x)$ at a point $x$ is defined as the limit of the ratio of the increment of the function to the increment of the argument, as the increment of the argument approaches zero:\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=\\lim _{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\nor\n\n$$\n\\frac{d y}{d x}=\\lim _{\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+\\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x} .\n$$\n\nIf $x$ changes, then the limit (2.1) will also change (for some $x$ it may not exist), hence the derivative of the given function is some function.\n\nA function that has a finite derivative is called differentiable. The operation of finding the derivative is called differentiation.\n\nGeometric meaning of the derivative. The derivative of a function $y=f(x)$ for each value of $x$ is equal to the slope of the tangent to the graph of the given function at the corresponding point, i.e.,\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}\\right)=\\operatorname{tg} \\alpha\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the angle formed by the tangent to the graph with the positive direction of the $O x$ axis of the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system; this angle is a function of the argument $x$.\n\nMechanical meaning of the derivative. For a function $s=f(t)$ that changes over time $t$, the derivative $s^{\\prime}$ is the rate of change of the function at a given moment $t_{0}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime}\\left(t_{0}\\right)=v\\left(t_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $v\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ is the rate of change of $s$ at the moment $t=t_{0}$.\n\nThe rate of physical, chemical, and other processes is expressed using the derivative.\n\nIf $u, v, w$ are differentiable functions of $x$, and $c$ is a constant, then the following basic rules of differentiation apply:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nc^{\\prime}=0 \\quad(c=\\text { const }) \\\\\n(u-v+w)^{\\prime}=u^{\\prime}-v^{\\prime}+w^{\\prime} \\\\\n(u v)^{\\prime}=u^{\\prime} v+u v^{\\prime} \\\\\n(c v)^{\\prime}=c v^{\\prime}(c=\\text { const }) \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{u}{c}\\right)^{\\prime}=\\frac{u^{\\prime}}{c} \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)^{\\prime}=\\frac{u^{\\prime} v-u v^{\\prime}}{v^{2}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n## \u00a7 2.1.

            "solution": "Solution. (a) From the condition $\\xi_{n}(\\omega) \\leqslant \\xi_{n+1}(\\omega)$ for some step functions $\\xi_{n}$ and $\\xi_{n+1}$ and almost all (by Lebesgue measure $\\left.\\lambda\\right) \\omega \\in(0,1]$, it follows that $\\xi_{n}(\\omega) \\leqslant \\xi_{n+1}(\\omega)$ for all $\\omega \\in(0,1]$. Therefore, the sequence $\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{n}$ is non-decreasing and, hence, has a limit when $\\xi_{n} \\uparrow \\xi$ (almost everywhere). Thus, the existence is established.\n\nNow let's prove the correctness. It is sufficient to establish the following lemma: if (almost everywhere) $\\xi_{n} \\uparrow \\xi \\geqslant \\eta$ for some step functions $\\xi_{n}$ and $\\eta$, then $\\lim _{n} \\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{n} \\geqslant \\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\eta$.

Let $\\varepsilon>0$ and $A_{n}=\\left\\{\\xi_{n} \\geqslant \\eta-\\varepsilon\\right\\}$. Then $A_{n}$ and $\\bar{A}_{n}$ can be represented as a union of a finite number of non-intersecting half-intervals $\\left(a_{i}, b_{i}\\right]$, $\\lambda\\left(\\bar{A}_{n}\\right) \\rightarrow 0$ and\n\n$$\n\\xi_{n}=\\xi_{n} I_{A_{n}}+\\xi_{n} I_{\\bar{A}_{n}} \\geqslant \\xi_{n} I_{A_{n}} \\geqslant(\\eta-\\varepsilon) I_{A_{n}}\n$$\n\nwhere all the functions involved here are step functions.

If we show that $\\xi_{n} \\uparrow \\xi$ and $\\eta_{n} \\downarrow \\xi$ almost everywhere, then this will mean that $\\xi,-\\xi \\in C^{+}$.\n\nLet $X=\\lim _{n} \\xi_{n}$ and $Y=\\lim _{n} \\eta_{n}$. Then $X \\leqslant \\xi \\leqslant Y$ everywhere, and $X,-Y, X-Y \\in C^{+}$ and $\\overline{\\mathrm{E}}(X-Y)=0$. The last equality is possible only if $X-Y=0$ almost everywhere, which can be proven directly, but it is easier to refer to part (d) and use a similar property of the Lebesgue integral. Thus, $X=\\xi=Y$ almost everywhere, so $\\xi,-\\xi \\in C^{+}$.\n\n(c) If $\\xi=\\xi_{+}-\\xi_{-}=\\eta_{+}-\\eta_{-}$ for some $\\xi_{+}, \\xi_{-}, \\eta_{+}, \\eta_{-} \\in C^{+}$, then (as can be obtained by a limiting transition from step functions) $\\xi_{+}+\\eta_{-}=\\eta_{+}+\\xi_{-} \\in C^{+}$ and\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{+}+\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\eta_{-}=\\overline{\\mathrm{E}}\\left(\\xi_{+}+\\eta_{-}\\right)=\\overline{\\mathrm{E}}\\left(\\eta_{+}+\\xi_{-}\\right)=\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\eta_{+}+\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{-}\n$$\n\nFrom this, the required correctness of the definition of $\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi$ follows.\n\n(d) Denote by $C^{+}-C^{+}$ the class of functions integrable in the Riesz sense. By construction, $C^{+}$ shows that $\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi=\\mathrm{E} \\xi$ when $\\xi \\in C^{+}$, and thus the class $C^{+}-C^{+}$ lies in the class of functions integrable in the Lebesgue sense.\n\nLet's check the reverse. First, note that the class $C^{+}-C^{+}$ is closed under subtraction, as well as addition and multiplication by any constant. For example, if $\\xi=\\xi_{1}-\\xi_{2}$ and $\\eta=\\eta_{1}-\\eta_{2}$, $\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2}, \\eta_{1}, \\eta_{2} \\in C^{+}$ and $\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{1}, \\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{2}, \\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\eta_{1}, \\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\eta_{2}1$, and also\n$\\left(\\zeta_{1}, \\eta_{1}\\right)=\\left(\\gamma_{1}, \\delta_{1}\\right)$. The functions $\\eta_{n}$ increase to some function $\\eta$, lie in the class $C^{+}$ and have sup $\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\eta_{n} \\leqslant 1$. The same is true for $\\zeta_{n}=\\xi_{n}+\\eta_{n}$ (with sup $\\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\zeta_{n} \\leqslant \\sup \\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{n}+1$ ). If the conditions $\\zeta_{n} \\uparrow \\zeta \\in C^{+}$ and $\\eta_{n} \\uparrow \\eta \\in C^{+}$ were satisfied, then we would necessarily have $\\xi=\\zeta-\\eta \\in C^{+}-C^{+}$.\n\nThus, it is sufficient to establish the closedness of $C^{+}$ under monotone limits, i.e., to prove that if $\\xi_{1}, \\xi_{2}, \\ldots \\in C^{+}$ such that $\\xi_{n} \\uparrow \\xi$ almost everywhere for some random variable $\\xi$ and $\\sup \\overline{\\mathrm{E}} \\xi_{n}0 \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\lambda((a, b] \\cap A)>0\n$$\n\nfor any half-interval $(a, b] \\subseteq(0,1]$, az)>0\\}0$, i.e., $c+1 \\leqslant M$.\n\nSince $\\eta_{n} \\uparrow \\eta$ and $\\lambda(\\eta>M-1 / 4)>0$ (by the definition of $M$), there exists some $n$ such that $\\eta_{n}=c$ on some half-interval $(a, b](a0$ and $\\lambda((a, b] \\cap A)>0$ for any half-interval $(a, b] \\subseteq$ $\\subseteq(0,1], a<b$. The set $A$ can be constructed as such.",

            "solution": "Solution. Let $y^{\\prime}=k, k=$ const. Then the equation of isoclines will be\n\n$$\ny-x^{2}+2 x-2=k, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad y=x^{2}-2 x+2+k\n$$\n\nThe isoclines are parabolas with a vertical axis of symmetry $x=1$. Among the isoclines, there are no integral curves. Indeed, substituting into the given equation $y=x^{2}-2 x+2+k$ and $y^{\\prime}=2 x-2$, we get $2 x-2=x^{2}-2 x+2+k-x^{2}+2 x-2$, or $2 x-2=k$. But this equality cannot hold identically for any value of $k$ with respect to $x$.\n\nLet $k=0$. Then at the points of intersection with the isocline $y=x^{2}-2 x+2$, the integral curves will have horizontal tangents. The isocline $y=$ $x^{2}-2 x+2$ divides the $x O y$ plane into two parts: in one part $y^{\\prime}<0$ (solutions $y$ decrease), and in the other part $y^{\\prime}>0$ (solutions $y$ increase). Since this isocline is not an integral curve, it contains the points of extremum of the integral curves, specifically on the part of the parabola $y=x^{2}-2 x+2$ where $x<1$ - points of minimum, and where $x>1$ - points of maximum. The integral curve passing through the point $(1 ; 1)$, i.e., through the vertex of the parabola $y=x^{2}-2 x+2$, does not have an extremum at this point. At the points of the isoclines $y=x^{2}-2 x+3$ ($k=1$) and $y=x^{2}-2 x+1$ ($k=-1$), the tangents to the integral curves have slopes of 1 and -1, respectively.\n\nTo investigate the direction of concavity of the integral curves, we find the second derivative:\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime \\prime}=y^{\\prime}-2 x+2=y-x^{2}+2 x-2-2 x+2=y-x^{2}\n$$\n\nIt is zero only at points lying on the parabola $y=x^{2}$.

The family of isoclines is defined by the equation $\\frac{y}{x}=k$. This is a family of lines passing through the origin, so at the origin, isoclines corresponding to different slopes of the tangents to the integral curves intersect.

If $\\varphi^{\\prime}(t)>0$, then the integral curves of the differential equation (2) approaching the curve $x=\\varphi(t)$ cannot cross this curve and remain in its neighborhood for $t>t_{0}$ (the initial point ( $t_{0}, x_{0}$ ) should be in the domain of attraction of the semi-stable solution $x=\\varphi(t)$; if $\\left(t_{0}, x_{0}\\right)$ is in the domain of repulsion, then the corresponding integral curve of the differential equation (2) quickly moves away from the curve $x=\\varphi(t))$ (Fig. 49). If $\\varphi^{\\prime}(t)0$ for $t_{0} \\leqslant tt_{1}$, then for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$, the integral curves starting from the point $\\left(t_{0}, x_{0}\\right)$, which belongs to the domain of attraction of the root $x=\\varphi(t)$, remain near the curve $x=\\varphi(t)$ for $t_{0}+\\delta0$; in the neighborhood of the point $t=t_{1}$, they cross the curve $x=\\varphi(t)$ and then move away from it.\n\nIf in the neighborhood of the semi-stable solution $x=\\varphi(t)$ the function $f(t, x) \\leqslant 0$, then to make the above statements valid, the signs of the derivative $\\varphi^{\\prime}(t)$ must be replaced by their opposites.",

Let's try to circumvent this difficulty in the following way: the numerator and the denominator can be factored into linear factors, so we can write: $\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}=$ $\\frac{(x-1)(x-2)}{(x-1)(x-3)}$ or, by canceling $x-1,=\\frac{x-2}{x-3}$. Let's substitute $x=1$ into this last expression and obtain the value $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the given algebraic fraction has a definite value for $x=1$, namely $\\frac{1}{2}$. However, this method of operation has a significant flaw. We canceled the numerator and the denominator by $x-1$, but this is only permissible when it is known in advance that $x-1$ is not zero (division by zero is not allowed!), i.e., that $x \\neq 1$, whereas we know the opposite: we are precisely looking for the value of the given expression for $x$. Therefore, we had no right to cancel by $x-1$. Let's now approach the question differently. For $x \\neq 1$, we have unconditionally: $\\quad \\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x}=\\frac{x-2}{x-3} . \\quad$ If $\\quad x \\quad$ approaches one infinitely (remaining always different from one), then the value of the expression\n$\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}=\\frac{x-2}{x-3}$ tends to the value $\\frac{1-2}{1-3}=\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus: although for $x=1$ the expression $\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}=\\frac{0}{0}$, i.e., is meaningless, nothing prevents us from agreeing to call the \"value of the fraction $\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}$ at $x=1$ \" the limiting value to which this fraction tends when $x$ approaches one infinitely (becomes one).",

Through the midpoint of the segment $A B$, draw a line perpendicular to the $O x$ axis. It will intersect the graph at the point $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 1\\right)$. The segment of this line from the $O x$ axis to the graph of the function $y=\\sin x$ has a length of 1.\n\nb) Here it is somewhat more difficult to construct a segment of unit length. The other constructions will be the same.\n\nLet $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary points on the $O x$ axis, satisfying the condition $0<b<a<\\alpha$. Construct the segment $A B$ of length $\\sin a+\\sin b$. Through the point $B$, draw a ray $l$ perpendicular to the segment $A B$. The circle with center at point $A$ and radius $2 \\sin \\frac{a+b}{2}$ intersects the ray $l$ at point $C$ (Fig. 11-3-sol-2). Since $\\sin a+\\sin b=2 \\sin \\frac{a+b}{2} \\cos \\frac{a-b}{2}$, then $\\angle C A B = \\frac{a-b}{2}$. On the segment $B C$, mark the point $D$ such that $B D=\\sin \\frac{\\alpha-b}{2}$. Through the point $D$, draw a line parallel to the segment $A B$. This line will intersect the segment $A C$ at point $E$. The length of the segment $A E$ is 1, since\n\n$$\n\\sin \\angle C A B=\\sin \\frac{a-b}{2}=\\frac{B D}{A E}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_15085dfe3c1d08e007efg-21.jpg?height=966&width=598&top_left_y=1614&top_left_x=730)\n\nSend a comment",

It turned out that each village is stronger than the next one in the clockwise direction. What is the maximum value that $k$ can have?

We will order the wrestlers in each village by decreasing strength and select the tenth strongest wrestler in each village. We will show that the village where the weakest of the selected wrestlers lives cannot be stronger than the next one. Let's denote the selected wrestlers in our and the next village as $A$ and $B$ respectively. Then, in our village, there are 11 wrestlers who are not stronger than $A$, and in the next village, there are 10 wrestlers who are not weaker than $B$. All 110 matches between these wrestlers will end in favor of the second village, meaning that the number of matches won by wrestlers from our village is no more than $20 \\cdot 20 - 110 = 290$.\n\nExample. Suppose there are 210 novices and 190 masters among the wrestlers (each novice is weaker than any master). We will number the villages counterclockwise. Place the weakest novice and 19 of the weakest masters in the first village; the two weakest remaining novices and 18 of the weakest remaining masters in the second village; the three weakest remaining novices and 17 of the weakest remaining masters in the third village; ...; and the 20 strongest novices in the last village. We will show that the $i$-th village is stronger than the $(i-1)$-th for $i>1$.\n\nIndeed, it has $i$ novices and $20-i$ masters. The masters of the $i$-th village will defeat all in the $(i-1)$-th, and the novices will defeat the novices, and the total number of victories will be $i(i-1) + \\{20(20-i) = i^2 - 21i + 400\\}$. The x-coordinate of the vertex of this parabola is 10.5, so the minimum value at an integer point is achieved at $i=10,11$ and is 290, meaning that the $i$-th village is stronger than the $(i-1)$-th for $k \\leq 290$. Additionally, the masters of the first village will defeat the novices of the 20th village, and the total number of victories will be $20 \\cdot 19 = 380 > 290$, meaning all conditions are met.\n\n## Answer\n\n290.\n\nSubmit a comment",

Furthermore, we have seen how to link some of these assertions to others using logical connectors such as disjunction and equivalence. We now need to focus on reasoning, that is, what allows us to say, knowing that certain propositions are true, that another proposition is true (or false).\n\nThe first of these modes of reasoning is reasoning by successive equivalences. It aims to answer questions of the type: \u00abWhat are the integers $n$ such that the property $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{n})$ is true?\u00bb To answer such a question, one seeks properties $\\mathrm{P}_{1}, \\mathrm{P}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{P}_{k}$ such that, for any integer $n$ considered, $P(n) \\Leftrightarrow P_{1}(n) \\Leftrightarrow P_{2}(n) \\Leftrightarrow \\cdots \\Leftrightarrow P_{k}(n)$. Then one can say that the integers $n$ such that the property $P(n)$ is true are exactly the integers $n$ such that the property $P_{k}(n)$ is true.\n\nNote, in passing, that this kind of reasoning is only of interest if the property $P_{k}$ appears simpler or more natural than the property $P$ itself. Otherwise, there would have been no need to bother, one could have been content with the (obvious but uninformative) statement that \u00abThe integers $n$ such that the property $P(n)$ is true are the integers such that the property $P(n)$ is true.\u00bb\n\n## Reasoning by analysis and synthesis\n\nIn some cases, it is difficult to proceed by successive equivalences: how to find the sequence of properties $\\mathrm{P}_{1}, \\mathrm{P}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{k}}$ that will work? One can then resort to another type of reasoning, a priori easier to find: reasoning by analysis and synthesis. It also aims to answer questions of the type: \u00abWhat are the integers $n$ such that the property $\\mathrm{P}(\\mathrm{n})$ is true?\u00bb However, the process followed is different.\n\nIn the first place, one seeks properties $\\mathrm{P}_{1}, \\mathrm{P}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{k}}$ such that, for any integer $n$ considered, $P(n) \\Rightarrow P_{1}(n) \\Rightarrow P_{2}(n) \\Rightarrow \\cdots \\Rightarrow P_{k}(n)$: this is the analysis phase. Then, in a second step, one seeks other properties $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, \\ldots, Q_{\\ell}$ such that, for any integer $n$ considered, $P_{k}(n) \\Rightarrow Q_{1}(n) \\Rightarrow Q_{2}(n) \\Rightarrow \\cdots \\Rightarrow Q_{\\ell}(n) \\Rightarrow P(n)$: this is the synthesis phase.\n\nOne can then deduce that $P(n) \\Rightarrow P_{k}(n)$ and that $P_{k}(n) \\Rightarrow P(n)$, which means that $P(n)$ and $P_{k}(n)$ are equivalent properties. Note that reasoning by successive equivalences is, in a sense, a special case of reasoning by analysis and synthesis, where one would have chosen $Q_{1}=P_{k-1}, Q_{2}=P_{k-2}, \\ldots, Q_{\\ell}=P_{1}$. However, if it is possible to proceed directly by successive equivalences, it is often simpler to present the result obtained.\n\nMoreover, it is certainly possible to reverse the order of the analysis and synthesis phases, or even to mix the two. In general, one can always allow oneself to mix several different types of reasoning; but then one must be very clear about the type of reasoning being followed: the reader must always have a fairly precise idea of the path taken in the reasoning, otherwise they will quickly be lost, and thus unable to understand it.",

First, it is clear that (iii) implies (ii). Furthermore, (i) implies (iii): each point $P_{i}$ with coordinates $\\binom{x_{i}}{f(x_{i})}$ belongs to the epigraph of $f$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} P_{i}$ is a convex combination of the points $P_{i}$, so it also belongs to the epigraph of $f$, which means exactly that the relation (iii) is satisfied.\n\nNext, let's show that if (i) is false, then (ii) is false as well: if $f$ is not convex, there exist two points $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ with coordinates $\\binom{x_{1}}{y_{1}}$ and $\\binom{x_{2}}{y_{2}}$, respectively, and a real number $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, such that $\\lambda P_{1} + (1-\\lambda) P_{2}$ does not belong to the epigraph of $f$, i.e., $\\lambda y_{1} + (1-\\lambda) y_{2} < f(\\lambda x_{1} + (1-\\lambda) x_{2})$. However, $y_{1} \\geq f(x_{1})$ and $y_{2} \\geq f(x_{2})$, so (ii) is false. By contraposition, (ii) implies (i), so (i), (ii), and (iii) are equivalent.\n\nFinally, let $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ such that $y = \\lambda x + (1-\\lambda) z$: each inequality in (iv) can be rewritten as $f(y) \\leq (1-\\lambda) f(z) + \\lambda f(x)$, so (iv) is equivalent to (ii).\n\nMoreover, if $f$ is differentiable, or even twice differentiable (i.e., differentiable and its derivative is also differentiable), we have additional criteria to detect a convex function.\n\nTheorem 59. Let $I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ be an interval and $f: I \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ a function (differentiable).

First, when $f$ is twice differentiable, (vi) and (vii) are equivalent, as we have partially shown in the part of the course on derivatives.\n\nFurthermore, if $f$ is convex, then in (iv), by letting $y$ tend to $x$ on one hand, and to $z$ on the other, we observe that $f'(x) \\leq \\frac{f(z) - f(x)}{z - x} \\leq f'(z)$. This shows that (i) implies (vi).\n\nThen, if (vi) is true, the function $h: t \\mapsto f(t) - f(x) - (t - x) f'(x)$ satisfies $h'(t) \\geq 0$ for $t \\geq x$ and $h'(t) \\leq 0$ for $t \\leq x$.

First, it is clear that (iii) implies (ii). Furthermore, (i) implies (iii): each point $P_{i}$ with coordinates $\\binom{x_{i}}{f(x_{i})}$ belongs to the epigraph of $f$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} P_{i}$ is a convex combination of the points $P_{i}$, so it also belongs to the epigraph of $f$, which means exactly that the relation (iii) is satisfied.\n\nNext, let's show that if (i) is false, then (ii) is false as well: if $f$ is not convex, there exist two points $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ with coordinates $\\binom{x_{1}}{y_{1}}$ and $\\binom{x_{2}}{y_{2}}$, respectively, and a real number $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$, such that $\\lambda P_{1} + (1-\\lambda) P_{2}$ does not belong to the epigraph of $f$, i.e., $\\lambda y_{1} + (1-\\lambda) y_{2} < f(\\lambda x_{1} + (1-\\lambda) x_{2})$. However, $y_{1} \\geq f(x_{1})$ and $y_{2} \\geq f(x_{2})$, so (ii) is false. By contraposition, (ii) implies (i), so (i), (ii), and (iii) are equivalent.\n\nFinally, let $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ such that $y = \\lambda x + (1-\\lambda) z$: each inequality in (iv) can be rewritten as $f(y) \\leq (1-\\lambda) f(z) + \\lambda f(x)$, so (iv) is equivalent to (ii).\n\nMoreover, if $f$ is differentiable, or even twice differentiable (i.e., differentiable and with a differentiable derivative), we have additional criteria to detect a convex function.\n\nTheorem.

First, when $f$ is twice differentiable, (vi) and (vii) are equivalent, as we have partially shown in the part of the course on derivatives.\n\nFurthermore, if $f$ is convex, then in (iv), by letting $y$ tend to $x$ on one hand, and to $z$ on the other, we observe that $f'(x) \\leq \\frac{f(z) - f(x)}{z - x} \\leq f'(z)$. This shows that (i) implies (vi).\n\nThen, if (vi) is true, the function $h: t \\mapsto f(t) - f(x) - (t - x) f'(x)$ satisfies $h'(t) \\geq 0$ for $t \\geq x$ and $h'(t) \\leq 0$ for $t \\leq x$. Thus, $h$ is decreasing on $\\{t \\in I: t \\leq x\\}$ and increasing on $\\{t \\in I: t \\geq x\\}$, so it attains its minimum at $x$.

Thus the set of points a distance z to z + \u03b4z from S is a strip of area p \u03b4z + 2\u03c0z \u03b4z. Thus the integral outside S is just \u222b 0 \u221e exp( - z) (p + 2\u03c0z) dz. This evaluates easily to p + 2\u03c0. 37th Putnam 1976 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 23 Jan 2001",

            "solution": ": 2/9. The corresponding indefinite integral is obviously intractable and the definite integral clearly diverges. But exp(a 3 )/a 4 also diverges. So we have the ratio of two divergent quantities. This calls for l'H\u00f4pital's rule: to evaluate lim f(a)/g(a) we take lim f'(a)/g'(a). The first step is to rearrange the integral so that a only occurs as an integration limit for one of the variables (thus making it easier to differentiate with respect to it). After a little experimentation we take s = x + y, t = x - y. The Jacobian is 1/2 and so we get 1/2 \u222b s=0 a \u222b -s s exp(s 3 /4 + 3s t 2 /4) dt ds. Differentiating wrt a, we get 1/2 \u222b -a a exp( a 3 /4 + 3a/4 t 2 ) dt = 1/2 exp(a 3 /4) \u222b -a a exp( 3a/4 t 2 ) dt. Similarly, differentiating the denominator gives (3/a 2 - 4/a 5 ) exp(a 3 ). We can cancel out the exp(a 3 /4) to get 1/2 \u222b -a a exp( 3a/4 t 2 ) dt and (3/a 2 - 4/a 5 ) exp(3a 3 /4), but both these still diverge. Accordingly, we must apply the rule again. We would like to eliminate the a in the integrand to make differentiation simpler. This can be achieved by setting s = a 1/2 t. Notice that the integrand has the same value for t and -t (or s and -s) so we can further simplify by taking the integration from 0 to a and doubling. Thus we get for the numerator a -1/2 \u222b 0 a\u221aa exp(3s 2 /4) ds. We can cancel the a -1/2 . Now differentiating the numerator gives exp(3a 3 4) 3a 1/2 /2. Differentiating the denominator gives (27a 1/2 /4 + lower powers of a ) exp(3a 3 /4).

            "solution": ": 3, 4, 7, 8. Note first that since cos x = cos(2\u03c0 - x), the integral is twice the integral over 0 to \u03c0, so it is sufficient to consider the smaller range. cos(n\u03c0/2 - x) = (-1) n cos(n\u03c0/2 + x). So cos(n\u03c0/2 - x)) = cos(n\u03c0/2 + x) for n even, and - cos(n\u03c0/2 + x) for n odd. Hence for n = 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, f n (\u03c0/2 - x) = - f n (\u03c0/2 + x) and so the integral over 0 to \u03c0 is zero. It remains to consider the cases n = 3, 4, 7, 8. I cannot see a neat way of proving them non-zero. What follows is an inelegant proof using cos a cos b = (cos(a+b) + cos(a-b) )/2 repeatedly. So cos x cos 3x = 1/2 cos 4x + 1/2 cos 2x. So f 3 (x) = 1/2 cos 2 2x + 1/2 cos 2x cos 4x = 1/2 cos 2 2x + 1/4 cos 2x + 1/4 cos 6x. The integral of the first term is positive and the integrals of the second and third terms are zero. So f 3 has non-zero integral. Similarly, f 4 (x) = (cos x cos 2x) (cos 3x cos 4x) = 1/4 (cos x + cos 3x)(cos x + cos 7x) = 1/4 cos 2 x + 1/8 (cos 2x + cos 4x + cos 6x + cos 8x + cos 4x + cos 10x). All terms except the first integrate to zero and the first has a non-zero integral. Hence f 4 has non-zero integral. Similarly, f 7 (x) = cos x (cos 2x cos 3x) (cos 4x cos 5x) (cos 6x cos 7x) = 1/8 cos x (cos x + cos 5x)(cos x + cos 9x)(cos x + cos 13x) = 1/8 cos x( cos 2 x + cos x cos 5x + cos x cos 9x + cos 5x cos 9x)(cos x + cos 13x) = 1/16 cos x (1 + cos 2x + cos 4x + cos 6x + cos 8x + cos 10x + cos 4x + cos 14x)(cos x + cos 13x) = 1/32 cos x (cos x + cos x + cos 3x + 2cos 3x + 2cos 5x + cos 5x + cos 7x + cos 7x + cos 9x + cos 9x + cos 11x + cos 13x + cos 15x + cos 11x + cos 15x + 2 cos 9x + 2 cos 17x + cos 7x + cos 19x + cos 5x + cos 21x + cos 3x + cos 23x + cos x + cos 27x) = 1/32 ( 3cos 2 x + other terms), where the other terms all have the form cos ax cox bx with a and b unequal and hence integrate to zero. So f 7 has non-zero integral. Finally, f 8 (x) = 1/16 (cos x + cos 3x)(cos x + cos 7x)(cos x + cos 11x)(cos x + cos 15x) = 1/32 (1 + 2 cos2x + 2cos 4x + cos 6x + cos 8x + cos 10x)(cos x + cos 11x)(cos x + cos 15x) = (4 cos x + 5 cos 3x + 4 cos 5x + 4 cos 7x + 4 cos 9x + 2 cos 11x + 2 cos 13x + 2 cos 15x + cos 17x + cos 19x + cos 21x)(cos x + cos 15x) = 1/64 (6 + other terms). So f 8 has non-zero integral. A neater approach is due to Xiannan Li First establish by induction that the sum over all 2 n terms cos(+-A+-B+-C + ... ), where we take every possible sign combination, is just 2 n cos A cos B ... .Now observe that the integral of cos mx is zero if m is non-zero and 2\u03c0 if m is zero. Thus the integral given is non-zero iff there is some sign combination for which 1 +- 2 +- 3 +- ... +- n = 0. If n = 4k, we have (1 + 4k) - (2 + 4k-1) + ... - (2k + 2k+1) = 0.

Similarly, if the vehicle's deceleration never exceeds 6.6 ft/sec 2 , then its deceleration in the last 20 seconds never exceeds 6.6 ft/sec, so the velocity curve it never gets above the line v = - 6.6 (t - 60), which represents constant deceleration at the maximum 6.6 ft/sec 2 from t = 40 until the finish at t = 60 when it is stationary. In fact the curve must lie strictly under this line, since the vehicle finishes in less than a minute. Hence the area under the curve, which represents distance travelled, is less than the area of the quadrilateral bounded by t = 0, v = 6.6t, v = 132 and v = -6.6(t - 60), which is 1/2 20. 132 + 20.132 + 1/2 20.132 = 40.132 = 5280 = 1 mile.

The official solution (Gleason et al, see foot of question paper , points out that almost the entire hypothesis is unnecessary. Suppose S is an entirely arbitary set of points in the plane, and that A and B are any two points in the plane (not necessarily in S). If X is a point of S such that PX + XQ \u2265 PY + YQ for all points Y of S, then we can easily show that S lies in the half-plane bounded by external angle bisector of PXQ. If X lies on PQ, then S must be a subset of the segment PQ and the result is trivial. So assume it does not. Now reflect Q in the bisector to get Q', with PXQ' a straight line. Then if Y is any point in the same half-plane as Q', we have YQ'  PY + YQ' \u2265 PQ' = PX + XQ' = PX + XQ, so Y is not in S. This argument depends upon X achieving a global maximum. The original wording of the question, \"a point ... for which ... is a maximum\" (which on this point I quoted exactly), is somewhat ambiguous. Does it mean a local or a global maximum? If it means a local, then we have to take S to be a small arc for which the maximum is global. Then that arc lies on one side of the line. Since it also has a point in common (X) and is differentiable, the line must be the tangent to the arc at X.

So If we sketch the integrand we find that it is positive and close to zero except for poles near -2, 1/2 and 1 1/2. So poles fall between the three ranges of integration. However, it still seems odd that we are given a sum of three ranges. So we look for a substitution that might bring the ranges into coincidence or something like it. A little tinkering suggests y = 1/(1-x). This takes (1/101, 1/11) to (101/100, 11/10), and (101/100, 11/10) to (-100, -10). We also find that it takes (x 2 - x)/(x 3 - 3x + 1) to (y 2 - y)/(y 3 - 3y + 1). Let I(a, b) = \u222b a b (x 2 - x) 2 /(x 3 - 3x + 1) 2 dx.

At this point we are in a difficulty. It is still not obvious how to evaluate the integral explicitly. But at the same time, there is no other obvious approach. If it does have a closed form, then (az 2 + bz + c)/(z 3 - 3z + 1) looks a good candidate. Differentiating this, we find that it does in fact work for a = -1, b = 1, c = 0.

The ellipse must be able to roll, in other words its maximum radius of curvature must be less than the minimum radius of curvature for the curve.

Then since f ' 2 + f 3 \u2192 0, we have f(x n ) \u2192 0. But f is monotonic on the interval [x n , x n+1 } since its derivative does not change sign, hence f \u2192 0. Hence also f ' \u2192 0. So we may assume that for sufficiently large x, f ' does not change sign. Now suppose f tends to a limit as x \u2192 \u221e. Then f ' must also tend to a limit. If that limit is non-zero, then f increases or decreases faster than some non-constant linear function for sufficiently large x and so cannot tend to a limit. Hence f ' must tend to zero. Hence f also. So we may assume that either (1) for sufficiently large x, f is strictly monotonic increasing and tends to infinity, or (2) for sufficiently large x, f is strictly monotonic decreasing and tends to minus infinity. The first case is impossible, because then f 3 and hence also f 3 + f ' 2 would tend to infinity. Showing that the second case is impossible needs a little more work. Suppose that for x \u2265 X, we have f(x)  f(x) 3 + f '(x) 2 > -1/4. Then 1/2 f(x) 3  1/2. Hence f '(x) 2 + 1/2 f(x) 3 > -1/4 - 1/2 f(x) 3 > 1/4 > 0.

Integrating the 1/x term over (2n/(2r+1), 2n/2r) gives n ln( (2r+1)/2r ), whilst over (2n/2r, 2n/(2r-1) ) gives - n ln( 2r/(2r-1) ). So over the combined interval (2n/(2r+1), 2n/(2r-1) ) we get - n ln ( 2r/(2r-1) 2r/(2r+1) ).

Define g(x) = f(x + 1/n) - f(x) for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1 - 1/n. We have to find a zero for g(x). Consider the n values g(0), g(1/n), g(2/n), ... , g((n-1)/n). If any of them are zero we are home. So assume they are all non-zero. Their sum is f(1) - f(0) = 0, so some must be negative and some positive. But g is continuous, so it must assume the intermediate value 0. Conversely, we construct a function which does not have any chords with lengths in the interval (1/(n+1), 1/n). We take a piecewise linear function such as that shown. All segments are in one of two directions. The horizontal distance between adjacent parallel lines of one set is DE, the horizontal distance for the other set is AC. The idea is that there are no horizontal lines with lengths between DE and AC. We choose the slope of the dotted lines so that AB = DE. The result is now clear from the diagram. We need A to be (0,0) and X to be (1,0). It is convenient to take the lines to have slopes \u00b11. Then the first peak has height AB/2. The second peak is BC/2 lower. So we need AB to be a multiple of BC. Suppose we take AB/BC = n. It is clear from the diagram that AX = nAC, so AC = 1/n. Hence AB = 1/(n+1), and BC = 1/(n(n+1)).

Not quite, because of the difficulty that f may be zero. For example, if we take g(x) = x f(x), then fg' - f 'g is zero whenever f(x) = 0. f has only finitely many zeros, for otherwise the zeros would have a limit point c and then by continuity we would have f(c) = f '(c) = 0. So we may take a polynomial p(x) such that p(x) f '(x) = -1 at each zero of f. Now consider g(x) = x f(x) + k p(x). We have f(x) g'(x) - f '(x) g(x) = f(x) 2 + k(f(x) p'(x) - f '(x) p(x) ).

Now [a, b] - K is compact and contains no zeros of f(x) 2 , which is continuous, so we can find \u03b5 > 0, so that f(x) 2 > \u03b5 on [a, b] - K.

The motivation for the problem is probably that if f and g are linearly independent solutions of y'' + a(x)y' + b(x)y = 0, then the Wronskian fg' - f 'g is non-zero.

This meets the parabola at x 2 + x/2a - a 2 - 1/2 = 0, so the other root is x = -1/2a - a and Q is (-1/2a - a, (a + 1/2a) 2 ). The area under the curve between P and Q is 1/3 (a 3 + (a + 1/2a) 3 ).

For the first half, the part of C 1 enclosed inside C 2 comprises two bent ovals, one at each end. It is tempting to think that when rolled flat, each piece is an ellipse. If that were true, then the problem would be trivial - the semi-axes are r 2 and r 1 sin -1 k, so the total area would be 2\u03c0 r 1 r 2 sin -1 k. But conics only remain conics when projected onto flat surfaces and here we are projecting onto a curved surface. So we have to use integration. Take C 1 to be x 2 + y 2 = r 1 2 , and C 2 to be y 2 + z 2 = r 2 2 . We calculate the area of the quarter of the piece with x > 0 having y, z > 0. We may divide it into strips parallel to the z- axis. Take the angle \u03b8 to be the axial angle - the angle by which the strip has to be rotated about the z- axis from the y = 0 position (keeping in the surface C 1 ). [Points on the strip have the same x and y coordinates, but varying z-coordinates.] The strip has y-coordinate r 1 sin \u03b8 and hence length (r 2 2 - r 1 2 sin 2 \u03b8) 1/2 and width r 1 d\u03b8. Thus the area of the quarter-oval is \u222b 0 sin -1 k (r 2 2 - r 1 2 sin 2 \u03b8) 1/2 r 1 d\u03b8. Put t = 1/k sin \u03b8, and the integral becomes r 2 2 \u222b 0 1 (1 - t 2 ) 1/2 (1 - k 2 t 2 ) -1/2 dt. Hence the complete oval is 4 times this, and the total area 8 times. Comments.

It is just the sum of a (1 - x) -1/2 and a (1 - x) -3/2 integral, both of which are straightforward.

We now need the Baire category theorem which states that if a union of closed sets covers the line, then one of the sets contains an open interval. This is bookwork. [But straightforward. Assume none of the B n contain an open interval. Take a point not in B 1 . Since B 1 is closed we may take a closed interval C 1 about the point, not meeting B 1 . Having chosen C n , there must be a point in it not in B n+1 (or B n+1 would contain an open interval - the interior of C n ). Hence we may take C n+1 , a closed subinterval of C n which does not meet B n+1 . Now C n is a nested sequence of closed intervals, so there must be a point X in all the C n But B n cover the line, so X must be in some B n .

Since $e^{\\cos x}$ is positive for all real $x$, the integrand $f(x)$ is positive for $-2019$. The essential idea is to interpret the integral as the signed area under the graph of $f(x)$, lying between $x=a$ and $x=b$. Hence, it is maximised when the interval of integration $(a, b)$ includes all positive values of $f(x)$ and does not include any negative values. So the answer is given by $(a, b)=(-20,19)$.\n\nMore precisely, let\n$$\nF(x)=\\int_{0}^{x} e^{\\cos t}\\left(380-t-t^{2}\\right) \\mathrm{d} t .\n$$\n\nWe will repeatedly use the fact that if $f(x)>0$ for $x \\in(a, b)$ with $a0$.

Therefore, the roots are contained in an arithmetic sequence with a difference of $\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$ and $\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{2}-1}$, respectively, extending infinitely in both directions.\n\nSuppose the function is periodic, and let $p$ be a positive period.\n\nFirst, we note that in one period, there can only be a finite number of elements from each arithmetic sequence, so there are only a finite number of roots in one period.\n\nAssign to each root the root in the interval $[0, p)$ that we get by adding some integer multiple of $p$ (i.e., for the root $x_{0}$, the number $x_{0}-\\left[\\frac{x_{0}}{p}\\right] \\cdot p$, which is also a root). Since there are infinitely many roots of the form $\\frac{2 k \\pi}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$, there must be two of them to which we assigned the same: $\\frac{2 k_{1} \\pi}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$ and $\\frac{2 k_{2} \\pi}{\\sqrt{2}+1}$, where $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are different integers.

Here, the tangent itself is the $x$-axis, and as $x$ increases and passes through the value 0, the curve transitions from below the tangent to above it. This can also be stated as follows: considering the ordinates of the points on the curve and the tangent at the inflection point with the same abscissa, their difference is positive when $x<0$. We consider this change in sign a characteristic property of the inflection point and the inflection tangent of any arbitrary function $f(x)$; more precisely: if $[u, f(u)]$ is an inflection point of the curve $y=f(x)$, then taking the tangent at $u$\n\n$$\ny=f(u)+f^{\\prime}(u)(x-u)\n$$\n\nwith the equation, the\n\n$$\nf(x)-\\left[f(u)+f^{\\prime}(u)(x-u)\\right]=g(x)\n$$\n\ndifference changes sign as it passes through $u$ [naturally, the value of the difference $g(u)=0$ at $u$]. - Of course, we are only considering differentiable $f$ functions.\n\nThe change in sign means that the curve of $g(x)$ transitions from below the $x$-axis to above it or from above to below as it passes through $u$.

            "solution": "The two functions are inverses of each other, so their graphs are mirror images with respect to the line $y=x$. If the function $x \\mapsto a^{x}$ has a point on the line $y=x$, then this point is also a point on the graph of the function $x \\mapsto \\log _{a} x$, and in this case, the sought distance is zero. Therefore, let's examine the function $f(x)=a^{x}-x$. If the graph of the function $x \\mapsto a^{x}$ has a common point with the line $y=x$, then the set of values of $f(x)$ will include non-positive numbers. The function $f(x)$ is continuous, and $f^{\\prime}(x)=\\left(a^{x}-x\\right)^{\\prime}=a^{x} \\cdot \\ln a-1$ is strictly increasing. Since $a^{x} \\cdot \\ln a-1$ is exactly 0 when $x=\\log _{a} \\log _{a} e$, the function $f(x)$ has an absolute minimum at this point.

            "problem": "$A, B, C$ are three different points on a parabola. What is the condition for the normals (that is, the perpendiculars to the tangents at these points) drawn at these points to intersect at one point?",
            "solution": "Any two parabolas are similar to each other, so it is enough to consider the parabola $p$ with the equation $y=x^{2}$. Let the abscissas of $A, B$, and $C$ be $a, b, c$ respectively, then their ordinates are $a^{2}, b^{2}$, and $c^{2}$. The condition $(a-b)(b-c)(c-a) \\neq 0$ is sufficient for $A, B$, and $C$ to be distinct points, because the parabola $p$ has exactly one point on any line parallel to its axis.\n\nAt any point $\\left(x_{1}, x_{1}^{2}\\right)$ on $p$, the slope of the tangent is the value of the derivative $\\left(x^{2}\\right)^{\\prime}=2 x$ at that point, which is $2 x_{1}$. The slope of the normal is $-1 /\\left(2 x_{1}\\right)$ (provided $x_{1} \\neq 0$), so the equation of the normal, using the form of a line with a given slope passing through a given point, is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\ny-x_{1}^{2}=-\\frac{1}{2 x_{1}}\\left(x-x_{1}\\right), \\text { rearranging } \\\\\nx+2 x_{1} y-2 x_{1}^{3}-x_{1}=0\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nIf $x_{1}=0$, i.e., the point is the vertex of $p$, then the normal is the $y$-axis, whose equation is $x=0$. The rearranged form (1) already includes this. For any two distinct points on $p$, the normals intersect at a single point because their slopes are different.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_6016c713b04cc9d69ce7g-1.jpg?height=680&width=730&top_left_y=752&top_left_x=684)\n\nWe seek the condition for the three normals, $n_{A}, n_{B}, n_{C}$, to intersect at a single point. Substituting $a$ and $b$ for $x_{1}$ in (1), we get\n\n\\[\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { the equation of } n_{A} \\quad x+2 a y-2 a^{3}-a=0 \\\\\n\\text { the equation of } n_{B} \\quad x+2 b y-2 b^{3}-b=0\n\\end{gathered}\n\\]\n\nFrom these, the coordinates of the intersection point $M$ of the first two normals, considering $b \\neq a$, are\n\n\\[\ny_{M}=a^{2}+a b+b^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad x_{M}=-2 a b(a+b)\n\\]\n\nThe coordinates of the intersection point $M^{\\prime}$ of $n_{A}$ and $n_{C}$ are obtained by substituting $c$ for $b$:\n\n\\[\ny_{M^{\\prime}}=a^{2}+a c+c^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad x_{M^{\\prime}}=-2 a c(a+c)\n\\]\n\nThe three normals intersect at a single point if and only if $M^{\\prime}$ coincides with $M$, since in this case $M$ is also on $n_{B}$ and $n_{C}$, and thus is the intersection point of $n_{B}$ and $n_{C}$. $M^{\\prime}$ coincides with $M$ if and only if $y_{M^{\\prime}}=y_{M}$, since no normal is parallel to the $x$-axis, and on any normal, the ordinate uniquely determines the abscissa. Therefore, $y_{M}=y_{M^{\\prime}}$ if and only if $y_{M}-y_{M^{\\prime}}=a(b-c)+b^{2}-c^{2}=(b-c)(a+b+c)=0$, and this, since $(b-c) \\neq 0$, holds if and only if\n\n\\[\na+b+c=0\n\\]\n\nThis, as is well known, means that the centroid $S$ of triangle $ABC$ lies on the line $x=0$, the $y$-axis, and, abstracting from the coordinate system, that $S$ lies on the axis of symmetry of $p$.\n\nRemark. After writing the equations of the normals, we can also proceed as follows: We seek the condition for the lines\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x+2 a y-2 a^{3}-a=0 \\\\\n& x+2 b y-2 b^{3}-b=0 \\\\\n& x+2 c y-2 c^{3}-c=0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nto have a common point, i.e., there exists a pair $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$ such that\n\n\\[\nx_{0}+2 z y_{0}-2 z^{3}-z=0\n\\]\n\nis a cubic equation whose roots are the distinct numbers $a, b, c$. According to the relationships between the roots and coefficients, the sum of the roots of the cubic equation\n\n\\[\nA z^{3}+B z^{2}+C z+D=0\n\\]\n\n(where $A \\neq 0$) is $-\\frac{B}{A}$, so $a, b, c$ can only be roots of (3) if\n\n\\[\na+b+c=0\n\\]\n\nsince $z^{2}$ does not appear in (3). This condition is therefore necessary for the three normals to intersect at a single point.\n\nWe show that the obtained condition is also sufficient. Indeed, according to the relationships between the roots and coefficients, $a, b, c$ are roots of the equation\n\n\\[\n2 z^{3}+B z^{2}+C z+D=0\n\\]\n\nif and only if\n\n\\[\nB=2(a+b+c), \\quad C=-2(a b+b c+c a), \\quad D=2 a b c\n\\]\n\nThus, if $a+b+c=0$, then\n\n\\[\nx_{0}=D=2 a b c, \\quad y_{0}=\\frac{C+1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}-(a b+b c+c a)\n\\]\n\nand $a, b, c$ are roots of (3), meaning the three normals pass through the point $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$.[^0]\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ See, for example, Hack Frigyes - Kugler S\u00e1ndorn\u00e9: Function Tables.

We will prove that the sought electric field strength is the same as that of an infinitely long linear charge. We need to show that the electric field strength created by the quarter-circle arc at the given point is the same as that of an infinitely long semi-infinite rod. Divide the arc into elementary segments, and for each elementary arc, assign a corresponding elementary segment on the semi-infinite rod as shown in the diagram. Thus, the quarter-circle arc can be mapped uniquely onto the semi-infinite rod. Now we will show that the electric field strength created by an elementary arc and the corresponding elementary segment is the same. The electric field strength created by the elementary arc at point $O$ is: $\\Delta E_{1}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{\\sigma \\Delta \\varphi}{R}$. The electric field strength created by the corresponding elementary segment is: $\\Delta E_{2}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{\\sigma \\Delta x}{l^{2}}$.

The inclusion $J_{m} \\supset J_{m+1}$ also holds, and $k_{m+1} J_{m+1} \\subset I_{n}$. This completes the definition of the sequences $J_{1}, J_{2}, \\ldots$ and $k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots$. From the definition, it is clear that $k_{n} \\geq n$, so $k_{n} \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nBy the Cantor axiom, the intervals $J_{1}, J_{2}, \\ldots$ have a common element. Let $a$ be such a common element.

            "problem": "Let's determine (by elementary means) the extreme values of the following function:\n\n$$\ny=x\\left(\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+1\\right)\n$$",
            "solution": "I. solution: Our function is defined for $-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$, but it is sufficient to examine the values $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$, because if the function has a value $y_{0}$ at some $x_{0}$, then for $-1 \\leq -x_{0} \\leq 0$, the value at $-x_{0}$ is $-y_{0}$. In the usual terminology: $y$ is an odd function, and its graph has the origin as a point of symmetry. Thus, if the function has a maximum at $x_{0}$, it has a minimum at $-x_{0}$, and vice versa.\n\nLet's write $\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}$ as $z$. Then $x=\\sqrt{1-z^{2}}, y=\\sqrt{1-z^{2}}(z+1)$, and as $x$ increases from 0 to 1, $z$ decreases from 1 to 0, so we examine the new function for $0 \\leq z \\leq 1$. - Thus, $y$ is never negative, so if it has a maximum, it is where the square of $y$, $y^{2}(1-z^{2})=(z+1)^{2}=(1-z)(z+1)^{3}$, has a maximum. To apply the inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means, let's examine three times this, because in $3 y^{2}=(3-3 z)(z+1)(z+1)(z+1)$, the sum, and thus the arithmetic mean, of the factors is constant: $3 / 2$. This value is also reached by the geometric mean of the factors, so there is a maximum, and it is when $3-3 z=z+1$, i.e., $z=1 / 2$. This value of $z$ is within the examined interval, with it, the maximum of $3 y^{2}$ at $x=\\sqrt{3} / 2$ is $(3 / 2)^{4}$, so the maximum of $y$ is $3 \\sqrt{3} / 4$.\n\nAccording to these and the previous remark, $y$ also has a minimum: at $x=-\\sqrt{3} / 2$, $y=-3 \\sqrt{3} / 4$.\n\nGy. Moln\u00e1r Szabolcs (Kis\u00fajsz\u00e1ll\u00e1s, M\u00f3ricz Zs. Gymn. III. grade)\n\nII. solution: The substitution $x=\\sin t$ is also useful, with which $\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}=|\\cos t|$. Due to the periodicity of $\\sin t$, there are infinitely many intervals for $t$ that, when traversed, yield every value of $x$ exactly once. It is useful to take the interval $-\\pi / 2 \\leq t \\leq \\pi / 2$, then $\\cos t \\geq 0$, and thus $y=\\sin t(\\cos t+1)=\\sin t+0.5 \\sin 2 t$.\n\nNow, finding the maximum among the positive values of $y$ is a special case of the question examined in problem 826 with $A=1$, $B=0.5$. With these, the formula obtained there gives $(\\cos t)_{1}=-1$, which is an excluded value for us, and $(\\cos t)_{2}=1 / 2$ leads to $(\\sin t)_{2}=x=\\sqrt{3} / 2$.\n\nGa\u00e1l S\u00e1ndor (Veszpr\u00e9m, Lovassy L. Gymn. IV. grade)\n\nIII. solution: For non-negative $x$, we can give a geometric interpretation to our question. $z=\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+1$ gives the $P Q$ ordinate in a rectangular coordinate system for the point $P$ on the upper half of the circle $k$ with radius $r=1$ centered at $(0,1)$, which has $x$ as its abscissa.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b8ea7b69457f020d5b4eg-1.jpg?height=466&width=556&top_left_y=1233&top_left_x=752)\n\nFigure 1\n\nIf $x \\geq 0$, the reflection of $P$ over the $Y$ axis is $P^{\\prime}$, and their projections on the $X$ axis are $Q$ and $Q^{\\prime}$; then the function $y=x z$ we are examining gives the area of the rectangle $Q P P^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}$, which is twice the area of the isosceles triangle $O P P^{\\prime}$ inscribed in $k$. In this interpretation, our task is to find the largest area among the non-obtuse isosceles triangles inscribed in the unit circle - if such a one exists at all. It is known that such a one exists: the equilateral triangle. 2.2\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b8ea7b69457f020d5b4eg-1.jpg?height=469&width=439&top_left_y=1999&top_left_x=824)\n\nFigure 2\n\nIts side $P P^{\\prime}=2 x=\\sqrt{3}$, so we again arrive at the maximum at $x=\\sqrt{3 / 2}$.\n\nP\u00f3sa Lajos (Bp. XIII., Sziget utcai \u00e1lt. isk. V. grade)\n\nIV. solution: Another geometric interpretation of $y$: half the perimeter of the isosceles triangle $A B C$ inscribed in a circle with diameter $A D=1$, if $A B=A C=x$. If the midpoint of $A B$ is $A_{1}$, then from the right triangles $A D B$ and $A B A_{1}$, $A A_{1} \\cdot A D=A A_{1}=A B^{2}=x^{2}$, and thus $B A_{1}^{2}=A A_{1} \\cdot A_{1} D=x^{2}\\left(1-x^{2}\\right)$, so the semiperimeter is: $A_{1} B+B A=x \\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+x=y$. According to this, our task is to determine the largest perimeter among the isosceles triangles inscribed in a circle with unit diameter, if such a one exists at all. It is known that such a one exists: the equilateral triangle, whose side is $x=\\sqrt{3} / 2$.\n\nBiborka Tam\u00e1s (Mak\u00f3, J\u00f3zsef A. Gymn. II. grade)\n\nRemark. Several solutions similar to III. or IV. concluded as follows: \"For every isosceles, non-equilateral triangle $H_{1}$, there is a larger area, larger perimeter isosceles triangle $H_{2}$ inscribed in the same circle, which is the acute isosceles triangle constructed on the base of $H_{1}$. In other words: the area and perimeter of $H_{1}$ can be increased, 'improved'. This process replaces the equilateral triangle $E$ with itself, so the area and perimeter of $E$ cannot be improved. Therefore, the area and perimeter of $E$ are maximal.\"\n\nThis reasoning is incorrect because $H_{2}$ is not equilateral, so it does not compare $H_{1}$ to $E$. The possibility or impossibility of increase alone does not guarantee the existence of a maximum. 4\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ See the solution in KML. XVI. volume, 17. p.

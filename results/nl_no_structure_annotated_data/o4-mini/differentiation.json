The second term is cos(log(x)) multiplied by log(5x + 2)^3, which requires the product rule as well. For the derivative of cos(log(x)), you will need to apply the chain rule to cos and then to log(x). For the derivative of log(5x + 2)^3, use the chain rule on the power and then on the log composed with a linear function. Next, after applying the product, chain, and sum rules, carefully expand and collect like terms to match the target formula.

Notice that (exp(x)) * (x^2 + 3) * cos(log(x)) * exp(x) * (x^2 + 3) can also be grouped for easier differentiation, but regardless of grouping, you must apply the product rule repeatedly. At each stage, when differentiating a product, you will need to differentiate one function at a time and multiply by the other factors. Inside some factors, you must also use the product or chain rule, for example when differentiating cos(log(x)), which requires chain rule. After applying the derivative rules carefully and expanding, algebraic simplification is required to show that both sides are equal. In this case, this will likely be the most tedious and detailed step. Finally, for each step in which you applied a derivative rule (such as chain rule, product rule, differentiating cos(log(x)), etc.), you must also check/prove that the inner parts are differentiable at x. For chain rule and product rule applications, all constituent functions must be differentiable at your point, which involves verifying differentiability of exp(x), x^2 + 3, cos(log(x)), log(x), and so on, at x \\u2260 0.

Some of these factors are themselves products (e.g., e^x * (x^2 + 3)), requiring further application of the product rule and sum rule.

We must differentiate this product, which is composed of five factors. This will require repeated application of the product rule, incorporating the chain rule whenever a composed function (such as cos(log(x)) or log(x)) appears. For each step where you differentiate a product of two functions, break their derivatives up using the product rule. For any factor that is itself a composition (such as cos(log(x)) or log(x)), use the chain rule to differentiate it. For the quotient log(x) / log(5), you will need to use the quotient rule when differentiating. After carrying out all the differentiation and simplifying stepwise, combine like terms and factor to match the target expression. This usually involves some algebraic manipulation and rearrangement. For each differentiation rule used above, verify and state the differentiability of each constituent function at x. This includes exp, powers, constants, cos(log(x)), log(x), and the constant log(5).

First, we must differentiate the overall function which is a product of two expressions. This requires us to apply the product rule.

For the numerator (e^x * (x^2 + 3)), use the product rule. 1.1.1.1. Differentiate e^x and (x^2 + 3) individually, combining via the product rule. 1.1.2. For the denominator, differentiate cos(log(x)), which involves the chain rule since log(x) is inside the cosine. The other main factor is (sin(2x - 1))^2, which you will differentiate using the chain rule and power rule. 1.2.1. Focus on the inside: sin(2x - 1), which itself is a composition, so you need the chain rule. After differentiating and combining several layers of rules, you must carefully expand and collect like terms to match the form of the equation given (algebraic simplification).

First, differentiate the function. Since the function is a product, use the product rule to expand the derivative. For the first term of the product, which is a quotient, use the quotient rule to compute its derivative. 1.1.1. The numerator involves differentiating e^x * (x^2 + 3), which uses the product rule. 1.1.2. For the denominator, differentiate cos(log(x)), which requires the chain rule and the derivative of log(x). The second term of the product is (log(5x + 2))^3, which will be differentiated using the chain rule and power rule. 1.2.1. This requires the derivative of log(5x + 2), itself computed using the chain and sum rules. Next, carefully expand, collect like terms, and simplify the resulting algebraic expression. This may require rearranging terms and using basic algebraic manipulation to match the required right-hand side. Lastly, ensure that you justify the differentiability and non-vanishing denominator conditions for each step. That is, for every differentiation step (product, quotient, chain), confirm (using the provided hypotheses or otherwise) that the needed nonzero and differentiability conditions truly hold at x.

First, we must differentiate the function, which requires using the chain rule on the outer sin, and then the sum rule inside. This involves: Differentiating (e^x) * (x^2 + 3) with the product rule and sum rule. Differentiate e^x. Differentiate x^2 + 3 using sum and power rules. Differentiating (sin(2x - 1))^2 using the power rule and chain rule. Differentiate sin(2x - 1) using the chain rule itself. Differentiate 2x - 1. After differentiating, we must expand and simplify the resulting algebraic expression to match the form on the right side, usually by distributing and collecting terms. Finally, for all the differentiation rules used above, we must check and justify that each constituent function is differentiable at the relevant points. Now we are done!\"}"

First, we must differentiate the composite function, which involves applying the chain rule for the cosine of a sum. You will also need to use the derivative of cosine. Next, you need to differentiate the sum inside the cosine, which splits by the sum rule into differentiating (e^x * (x^2 + 3)) and (sin(2x - 1))^2 separately. To differentiate (e^x * (x^2 + 3)), you will use the product rule. This involves differentiating e^x and differentiating (x^2 + 3), which in turn uses the sum and power rules. To differentiate (sin(2x - 1))^2, use the chain rule (for the power) and then the chain rule again (for the inside function sin(2x - 1)). Differentiating sin(2x - 1) requires the chain rule because of the linear function 2x - 1 inside. You'll also need the product rule when differentiating the squared term. You must then combine all the differentiated parts according to the rules above, keeping track of coefficients and products. Next, simplify the resulting algebraic expression so that it matches the right side of the equation (this is usually straightforward but keep careful track of negative signs and coefficients). Finally, remember that every differentiation step you performed relies on the differentiability of the constituent functions; confirm these differentiability conditions for e^x, x^2, sin, cos, and polynomials within the appropriate domains.

First, differentiate the composite function using the chain rule. This involves differentiating the outer tangent function and then differentiating the entire inner argument. The derivative of the sum (the argument of tangent) itself requires you to apply the sum, product, and chain rules as needed: Compute the derivative of (e^x) * (x^2 + 3) using the product rule and the chain rule. Compute the derivative of (sin(2x - 1))^2 by first applying the power rule, then multiplying by the derivative of the inner sine function. This latter derivative involves the product and difference rules. After differentiating, combine and simplify the resulting terms so that the final result is expressed as a single fraction as shown. Finally, make sure to check (or verify) the differentiability of every sub-function you differentiated, as the use of the chain, product or composition rule is only valid under these conditions (including the nonvanishing of the denominator for tan)'s derivative). And that completes the calculation.\"}"

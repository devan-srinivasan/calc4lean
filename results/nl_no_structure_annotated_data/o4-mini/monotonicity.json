Show that f is continuous on D. Each term in f(x) is a (constant times) power of x, or a constant, all of which are continuous. Thus, f is continuous as a sum of continuous functions. Conclude that f is monotonic on D by appealing to the general result that a continuous function on a convex domain with strictly positive derivative in the interior is monotone on that domain.

This can be done using the fact that closed intervals are convex sets. Next, we show that the derivative of f is positive in the interior of D: We assume that x is in the interior of D, i.e., 0 < x < 4. We differentiate f(x), applying the differentiation rules for sums, products by constants, and powers. This yields an expression for the derivative as a sum of terms, all of which depend on positive powers of x with positive coefficients. We observe that all terms in the derivative are strictly positive on the interior of D because each coefficient is positive and x > 0, so each individual term is positive. Their sum is thus positive. We recall that differentiation rules require differentiability of the constituent functions, so we verify that all the relevant functions (powers and multiples of x) are differentiable at every point in D. With this, we see that f' is positive on the interior of D. We now verify continuity of f on D. This can be established because each summand is continuous and sums/products of continuous functions are continuous. With convexity of D, continuity of f, and strict positivity of the derivative on the interior, we can now conclude that f is monotone (in fact, strictly increasing) on D. Done.\"}"

We will approach this by establishing the following steps: First, prove that D is a convex set. This can be accomplished by noting that any closed interval in \\u211d is convex. Next, show that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D: Assume x is in the interior of D, so 0 < x < 10. Compute the derivative of f(x). This involves repeatedly applying basic differentiation rules, and then simplifying the resulting expression. After simplification, observe that the derivative is a sum of terms where each term is clearly positive for x in the given range. Show that each term in the derivative expression is positive for all x in the interior of D. This can be done by proving positivity of each term separately, often by reducing them to showing that powers of x are positive when x > 0, and using the positivity of coefficients. Remember to verify that each function from which the derivative is computed is differentiable at relevant points. At this point, we have shown that f' is strictly positive on the interior of D. Show that f is continuous on D, which can be deduced by checking that each polynomial term is continuous, and finite sums of continuous functions are continuous. Having established convexity of D, strict positivity of the derivative on the interior, and continuity, we can then conclude that f is monotonic on D.  This completes the proof structure.\"}"

These facts together then allow us to conclude that f is monotonic on D. To show D is convex, recall that closed intervals in \\u211d are convex sets. To show that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D, proceed as follows: Assume x is inside the interior of D, i.e., 0 < x < 2. Compute the derivative by repeatedly applying differentiation rules (sum, product, constant, and power rules as applicable) to each term of f. After differentiation, you will get a sum where each term is of the form (positive constant) * (positive power of x). Argue why each term is strictly positive for x in (0, 2), possibly by handling each monomial separately. Sum all positive terms and conclude that the derivative is positive on the open interval. 2.5. Ensure that for each differentiation step, the constituent functions are differentiable on D. Show that f is continuous on D by arguing that each term is a continuous function and the sum of continuous functions is continuous. Use results about monotonicity when the derivative is positive, combined with the earlier convexity and continuity arguments, to conclude that f is monotonic on D. Now the proof is complete.\"}"

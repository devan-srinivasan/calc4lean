Next, we show that the derivative of f is positive throughout the interior of D, then show continuity of f on D, after which we can conclude monotonicity.\\n\\n1. We can show that D is convex by relying on the fact that any closed interval in \\u211d is convex.\\n2. To show that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D, we proceed as follows:\\n    2.1. Assume x is in the interior of D, so 5 < x < 15.\\n    2.2. Differentiate f(x). This will involve applying differentiation rules (such as for sums, differences, constants, and powers), and after simplification, it reduces to checking that (8 * x - 40) > 0.\\n    2.3. Now, we must verify the inequality for all x in (5, 15). The calculation is simple since for x > 5, 8 * x - 40 > 0 holds on the interval.\\n    2.4. As part of justifying the differentiation, we need to check that each piece (x \\u21a6 x, x \\u21a6 x^2, constants) is differentiable, but this is straightforward for polynomials.\\n3. We then show that f is continuous on D by noting that each term in f is continuous, and so finite sums and products of continuous functions remain continuous.\\n4. Finally, we use that f is continuous, D is convex, and f\\u2032 > 0 on the interior to conclude that f is monotonic on D.\\n\\nNow the proof is complete.\"}"

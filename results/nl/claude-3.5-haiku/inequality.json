Observe that the resulting inequality can be transformed to a perfect square being non-negative (namely, (p'(x2) - 15)\\u00b2 \\u2265 0).\\n        3.3.5. Conclude f'(x2) \\u2265 0 as a square is always non-negative.\\n        3.3.6. Where differentiation rules were used, confirm the differentiability of the constituent functions at any relevant step.\\n    3.4. Apply a monotonicity result ensuring that f is monotonic on D, as the derivative is non-negative and f is continuous/differentiable on D.\\n4. Show that f(x) > 0 for x \\u2208 [0, 1].\\n    4.1. Confirm that x \\u2208 [0, 1], so x \\u2265 0.\\n    4.2. Use the monotonicity of f on D to assert f(x) \\u2265 f(0), and thus f(x) > 0 by earlier step.\\n5. Observe that f(x) > 0 is equivalent to the original statement, p(x) + 3\\u00b7q(x) > 30\\u00b7x, by algebraic rearrangement.\\n6. Conclude the proof.\"}"

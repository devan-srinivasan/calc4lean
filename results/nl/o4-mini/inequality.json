Our goal is to show that for x \\u2208 [0, 1], we have p(x) + 3\\u00b7q(x) > 30\\u00b7x. The idea is to define an auxiliary function f(x) = p(x) + 3\\u00b7q(x) - 30\\u00b7x and prove that f(x) > 0 for x in [0, 1]. This will follow from f(0) > 0 and monotonicity of f on [0, 1], showing f is increasing and starts positive. The proof structure proceeds as follows:\\n\\n1. Define f(x) = p(x) + 3\\u00b7q(x) - 30\\u00b7x, and let D = [0, 1].\\n2. Prove f(0) > 0.\\n    2.1. Substitute x = 0 into f. Use assumptions about p(0), q(0), and q(0) > 0 to show f(0) > 0 is true, by direct computation and multiplication positivity.\\n3. Show that f is monotonic (non-decreasing) on D.\\n    3.1. Prove f is differentiable over \\u211d using the differentiability of p, q, and linearity rules.\\n    3.2. Conclude f is differentiable on the interior of D by restriction, and hence continuous on D.\\n    3.3. Prove for all x2 \\u2208 interior D, the derivative f'(x2) \\u2265 0:\\n        3.3.1. Write out f'(x2) using the chain rule for derivatives.\\n        3.3.2. Use p'(x2) > 0 and the equation p'(x2) q'(x2) = 75 to express q'(x2) in terms of p'(x2).\\n        3.3.3. Substitute q'(x2) = 75 / p'(x2) into the expression for f'(x2) and simplify.\\n        3.3.4. Observe that the resulting inequality can be transformed to a perfect square being non-negative (namely, (p'(x2) - 15)\\u00b2 \\u2265 0).\\n        3.3.5. Conclude f'(x2) \\u2265 0 as a square is always non-negative.\\n        3.3.6. Where differentiation rules were used, confirm the differentiability of the constituent functions at any relevant step.\\n    3.4. Apply a monotonicity result ensuring that f is monotonic on D, as the derivative is non-negative and f is continuous/differentiable on D.\\n4. Show that f(x) > 0 for x \\u2208 [0, 1].\\n    4.1. Confirm that x \\u2208 [0, 1], so x \\u2265 0.\\n    4.2. Use the monotonicity of f on D to assert f(x) \\u2265 f(0), and thus f(x) > 0 by earlier step.\\n5. Observe that f(x) > 0 is equivalent to the original statement, p(x) + 3\\u00b7q(x) > 30\\u00b7x, by algebraic rearrangement.\\n6. Conclude the proof.\"}"

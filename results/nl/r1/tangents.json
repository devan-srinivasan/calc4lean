Assume differentiability at both parts.\\n4) Use this split and properties of linear maps to further write the gradient at the relevant point and apply it to (x-(-5), y-5).\\n5) Show that the evaluation of the gradient of (5x^4 + x^3 - x^2 - 2x) at (-5, 5), in the direction (x-(-5), y-5), yields (x-(-5)) * (-2417):\\n   5.1) Express the function as a composition with the projection to the first coordinate and apply composition and differentiation rules.\\n   5.2) Compute the derivative of the polynomial in x, substitute x = -5, and apply linear map rules to obtain the result.\\n   5.3) Establish differentiability of the polynomial part with respect to x.\\n6) Show that the evaluation of the gradient of (3y^4 + y^2) at (-5, 5), in the direction (x-(-5), y-5), yields (y-5) * (1510):\\n   6.1) Express the function as a composition with the projection to the second coordinate and apply differentiation rules accordingly.\\n   6.2) Compute the derivative of the polynomial in y, substitute y = 5, and apply linear map rules to get the value.\\n   6.3) Show differentiability for the relevant function of y.\\n7) Show that the constant term \\u2207(c) applied at any point is zero.\\n8) Substitute the results for the gradients/evaluations above into the hypothesis, simplify, and deduce that (x-(-5)) * (-2417) - (y-5) * (1510) = 0.\\n9) Justify differentiability of all relevant component functions and combinations at the point of interest.\"}"

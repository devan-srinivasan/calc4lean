Start by applying the chain rule for the outermost cosine function.\\n   1.2. This requires you to compute the derivative of the inside (let's call it u(x)).\\n   1.3. u(x) is a sum: one summand is (e^x) * (x^2 + 3), and the other summand is (x^3) * (log(x) / log(5)).\\n2. Now, differentiate each component of u(x):\\n   2.1. For (e^x) * (x^2 + 3):\\n       2.1.1. Use the product rule.\\n       2.1.2. When differentiating x^2 + 3, use the power rule and derivative of a constant.\\n   2.2. For (x^3) * (log(x) / log(5)):\\n       2.2.1. Use the product rule again.\\n       2.2.2. For log(x) / log(5), use the quotient rule (since log(5) is constant).\\n       2.2.3. Derivative of log(x) is 1/x, and derivative of log(5) is 0 (since it's constant).\\n3. Once you have computed du/dx, combine it with the chain rule from the derivative of cosine.\\n   3.1. Be careful with distributing the minus sign introduced by the derivative of cosine.\\n   3.2. Collect like terms and simplify the algebra so that your expression matches the claimed right side.\\n4. To finish, make sure you check that each function you differentiate is indeed differentiable at the required points (e.g., x \\u2260 0 for log(x), log(5) \\u2260 0 for the denominator).\\n   4.1. You may need to explicitly verify differentiability for each elementary piece.\\n\\nNow you are done!\"}"

For the second term, use the chain rule to differentiate cos(log(x)), which includes differentiating log(x).\\n   1.3.

Differentiating x^3 using the power rule.\\n      3. Differentiating (log(x) / log(5)), which is a quotient, and the denominator log(5) is a constant, so you ultimately need the derivative of log(x).\\n3. After obtaining the derivatives, simplify the entire expression algebraically until it matches the simplified form given in the statement. This often requires field and ring manipulations to tidy numerical and algebraic coefficients and regroup terms.\\n4.

You'll need the derivative of sin(2x - 1), which itself is a composition.\\n2. Next, after differentiating, you need to carefully simplify and combine like terms so both sides of the equation are clearly equal. This usually involves algebraic manipulation.\\n3. For each differentiation step, you must also justify that all the functions are differentiable at the appropriate points.

The first step is to differentiate the whole function, which is a sum:\\n   1. For the first term (sin(2x - 1))^2, you need to use the chain rule and power rule, and within that, use the chain rule for the inside sin(2x - 1).\\n       1. This will require differentiating sin(2x - 1), which itself uses the chain and product rules.\\n   2. For the second term (x^3 * (log(x) / log(5)) * exp(x) * (x^2 + 3)), note this is a product of four factors in x, so you need to use the product rule repeatedly:\\n       1. Compute the derivative with respect to each factor while keeping the other factors fixed and account for all the combinations (sum of four terms, because there are four multiplicands).\\n       2. For the derivative of x^3, you use the power rule.\\n       3. For the derivative of log(x) / log(5), note that log(5) is constant and log(x) requires you to use the quotient rule and the chain rule.\\n       4. For the derivative of exp(x), recall how to differentiate exponentials.\\n       5. For the derivative of (x^2 + 3), use the power rule and the sum rule.\\n2. Once the derivatives are computed, you will need to collect terms and algebraically rearrange to match the target form. This step is often handled by basic algebraic manipulation.\\n3. Finally, for justification, you need to confirm that each function in the composition and product is differentiable at x, given the assumptions (e.g., x \\u2260 0 ensures log(x) is differentiable etc). Each application of the chain, product, or quotient rule hinges on these differentiability conditions.\\nNow you are done!\"}"

Apply the chain rule for the tangent function, noting that the argument must be differentiable and non-singular for tan.\\n    1.2. Compute the derivative of the argument, which is the product of (sin(2x - 1))^2, x^3, and (log x / log 5). This will involve the product rule twice.\\n    1.3. For (sin(2x - 1))^2, apply the chain rule and power rule: this will require first differentiating sin(2x - 1) with respect to x (which itself requires use of the chain and product rule), and then applying the power rule.\\n    1.4. For x^3, use the power rule.\\n    1.5. For (log x / log 5), use the quotient rule and the chain rule; note that log 5 is a constant.\\n2. After calculating these derivatives, carefully expand and group the terms, and combine them over a common denominator if needed. Simplify the algebra to match the target formula.\\n3. Finally, for each differentiation rule used above, provide evidence that all relevant functions are differentiable at x. This includes checking differentiation of the inside and outside functions, and ensuring all quotient denominators are nonzero under the given assumptions.\\nNow the proof is complete!\"}"

Raising sin(2x - 1) to the power 2; you'll need the power rule in combination with the chain rule.\\n    1.3. Dividing by x^3; this requires the quotient rule, with (sin(2x - 1))^2 in the numerator and x^3 in the denominator.\\n    1.4. Multiplying the result by (log(x) / log(5)); here you use the product rule, and note that one part is a quotient involving logarithms (so you will also need the quotient rule for differentiating log(x)/log(5)).\\n    1.5. All of this is inside a sine as the outermost function, so you'll apply the chain rule once more for that.\\n2. After obtaining the derivative expression, simplify the resulting algebraic expression to match the form shown on the right-hand side of the equation.\\n3. Finally, for every differentiation step, confirm that all involved functions are differentiable at the relevant points to validate your application of the above rules.\\nNow you are done!\"}"

Start by applying the chain rule for the outermost cosine function.\\n   1.2. This requires you to compute the derivative of the inside (let's call it u(x)).\\n   1.3. u(x) is a sum: one summand is (e^x) * (x^2 + 3), and the other summand is (x^3) * (log(x) / log(5)).\\n2. Now, differentiate each component of u(x):\\n   2.1. For (e^x) * (x^2 + 3):\\n       2.1.1. Use the product rule.\\n       2.1.2. When differentiating x^2 + 3, use the power rule and derivative of a constant.\\n   2.2. For (x^3) * (log(x) / log(5)):\\n       2.2.1. Use the product rule again.\\n       2.2.2. For log(x) / log(5), use the quotient rule (since log(5) is constant).\\n       2.2.3. Derivative of log(x) is 1/x, and derivative of log(5) is 0 (since it's constant).\\n3. Once you have computed du/dx, combine it with the chain rule from the derivative of cosine.\\n   3.1. Be careful with distributing the minus sign introduced by the derivative of cosine.\\n   3.2. Collect like terms and simplify the algebra so that your expression matches the claimed right side.\\n4. To finish, make sure you check that each function you differentiate is indeed differentiable at the required points (e.g., x \\u2260 0 for log(x), log(5) \\u2260 0 for the denominator).\\n   4.1. You may need to explicitly verify differentiability for each elementary piece.\\n\\nNow you are done!\"}"

For the second term, use the chain rule to differentiate cos(log(x)), which includes differentiating log(x).\\n   1.3.

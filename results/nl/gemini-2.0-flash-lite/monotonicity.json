Assume x is in the interior of D, so 6 < x < 10.\\n    2.2. Compute the derivative of f. Using rules for polynomial differentiation, simplify the result to obtain an explicit expression for f'(x).\\n    2.3. Show that this expression is positive whenever 6 < x < 10. This involves a straightforward inequality for a linear function, which follows from the bounds on x.\\n    2.4. Note that for each differentiation and simplification, you will need to confirm differentiability of the respective parts (constants, identities, powers, sums, subtractions, etc).\\n3. Establish that f is continuous on D. This follows directly since f is a sum of continuous functions (polynomials are continuous everywhere), and you should justify each term's continuity.\\n4. Now you may conclude that f is monotonic on D, via the positivity of the derivative and the structure provided by convexity and continuity.\\n\\nYou are now done.\"}"

Let x be an arbitrary point in the interior of D, so 3 < x < 10.\\n    2.2. Compute the derivative of f step-by-step using differentiation rules, which will yield f'(x) = 18*x - 54.\\n    2.3. Show that 18*x - 54 > 0 for all x in the interior of D. In this case, because x > 3, this inequality can be easily verified with basic algebra.\\n    2.4. For each differentiation step applied above, show that the relevant constituent functions are differentiable.\\n3. Prove f is continuous on D. This is straightforward since each term in f is continuous and so their combination is continuous as well.\\n4. In conclusion, since the derivative is positive, f is strictly increasing, and so is monotonic on D.\\n\\nNow the proof is complete.\"}"

First, assume x is in the interior of D, so 10 < x < 19.\\n    2.2. Differentiate the function f(x). You'll use appropriate differentiation rules (like sum, product, power, and constant rules) for each term, and combine them. After simplifying, you are left with an expression in x.\\n    2.3. Show that the resulting expression is positive whenever x is in the interior of D. Here, simple algebraic manipulation should show positivity.\\n    2.4. Each time you use a differentiation rule, you need to justify that the individual pieces you're differentiating are differentiable at x.\\n3. To show continuity, argue that each piece (every term in the polynomial) is continuous, and so their sum is continuous as well.\\n4. Using convexity, positivity of the derivative, and continuity, you can conclude the monotonicity of f on D.\\n\\nNow the proof is done.\"}"

The general approach is to prove that D is convex, that f' > 0 on the interior of D, and that f is continuous on D. This will allow us to conclude monotonicity.\\n1.

Next, establish that the derivative of f is positive everywhere in the interior of D:\\n    2.1. Let x be in the interior of D, so 0 < x < 8.\\n    2.2. Compute the derivative of f, making repeated use of the sum, power, and constant rules for derivatives. After expanding and simplifying, you will obtain a sum of terms of the form c * x^k for various k, plus constants.\\n    2.3. Show each term in this sum is positive when x > 0, by considering powers of x and positive coefficients, and then combine the inequalities to conclude their sum is also positive.\\n    2.4.

To do this, we first prove that D is convex. Then we show that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D. Next, we show that f is continuous on D. Finally, we use these facts to conclude monotonicity. The high-level structure is:\\n\\n1. Prove D is convex. This can be done by appealing to the fact that a closed interval is convex.\\n\\n2. To show that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D:\\n    2.1. Start by assuming x is in the interior of D, i.e., 0 < x < 2.\\n    2.2. Compute the derivative of f(x), which combines several differentiation rules for polynomials. After simplifying, you get a sum of positive terms for x > 0.\\n    2.3. To show that the sum is positive, demonstrate that each term in the derivative is positive for x in (0,2). For powers of x with positive coefficients, showing x > 0 suffices. The linear term is trivially positive. You may wish to prove each term is positive as an intermediate step.\\n    2.4. Also, the differentiation rules require you to show that each basic function being used is differentiable at x\\u2014which is direct for polynomials.\\n\\n3.

This follows directly, since sums and products of continuous functions (such as powers of x and constants) are continuous, and the entire expression is thus continuous on any interval.\\n4. Having established convexity, strict positivity of the derivative on the interior, and continuity, apply the result that a function is monotonic on D under these conditions.\\n\\nNow the proof is complete.\"}"

We show that D is convex. This follows from the general fact that any closed interval in \\u211d is convex.\\n\\n2. We prove that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D:\\n    2.1. To do this, we first assume x is in the interior of D, i.e., 0 < x < 5.\\n    2.2. We differentiate the function f. Differentiating each term and adding, we reduce our task to proving that 56 * x^6 + 60 * x^4 + 60 * x^3 + 8 * x + 11 > 0 for all x in the interval (0, 5). You should use differentiation rules for addition, multiplication, and powers, applying them stepwise.\\n    2.3. We then show this sum is indeed positive for x in (0, 5). This is done by checking that each term in the sum is positive for all x in the open interval (0, 5):\\n        2.3.1. The constant term 11 is always positive.\\n        2.3.2. The term 8 * x is positive because x > 0.\\n        2.3.3. The terms 60 * x^3 and 60 * x^4 are positive because a positive x raised to any power is positive, and multiplied by a positive constant.\\n        2.3.4. The term 56 * x^6 is likewise positive for the same reason.\\n        2.3.5. Since the sum of positive numbers is positive, the whole expression is positive for x in (0, 5).\\n    2.4. Each time you differentiate a term, you should also make sure to justify the differentiability of the relevant component functions\\u2014constants, powers, and the identity, all of which are differentiable everywhere.\\n\\n3. We establish continuity of f on D. This is straightforward, as each term in f is continuous, so their sum is also continuous on D.\\n\\n4. With these facts (convexity of D, continuity of f, and strictly positive derivative on the interior), you can conclude that f is monotonic (in fact, strictly increasing) on D.\\n\\nThis completes the proof.\"}"

+ 18 * x is monotonic on D = [0, 5]. We will do so step by step, reflecting the mathematical structure in the proof:\\n1. First, prove that D is convex. This uses the general fact that any closed interval is convex.\\n2. Next, we need to prove that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D. This argument unfolds as follows:\\n    2.1. We assume x is in the interior of D, i.e., 0 < x < 5.\\n    2.2. Differentiate the function f term by term, which involves repeatedly using the differentiation rules for each sum, product, and power. After expanding, you will see that f'(x) is a sum of positive multiples of powers of x and a constant term.\\n    2.3. We rewrite the resulting sum and see that every term is of the form (positive constant) times (positive power of x) (since x > 0 in the interior) or a positive constant. For each term, establish nonnegativity or positivity, typically by observing x > 0, so x^k > 0, multiplying through, and then adding the positive terms together.\\n    2.4. We must also check at this point (often at the end of the differentiation step) that each individual subterm we differentiated is indeed differentiable at x.\\n    2.5. After showing each term is positive for 0 < x < 5, we may add these results using a linear combination to conclude the full derivative is positive in the interior of D.\\n3. Next, prove that f is continuous on D. This is usually done by noticing that each basic building block (power, multiplication, sum) is continuous, so the full polynomial is continuous.\\n4. Having established convexity of D, continuity of f, and positivity of the derivative on the interior, we can combine these facts to conclude that f is monotonic on D.\\nNow the proof is complete.\"}"

To prove the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D, we proceed as follows:\\n    2.1. First, assume x is in the interior of D, so 0 < x < 7.\\n    2.2. Next, differentiate the function by applying the rules for linearity, addition, and product with constants, as well as the power rule. This will show that the derivative simplifies to 77 * x^6 + 8, and we need to prove this is positive on the interior of D.\\n    2.3. To prove 77 * x^6 + 8 > 0, observe that x > 0 ensures x^6 > 0, so both summands are positive and thus their sum is positive.\\n    2.4. Make sure to check differentiability for each term after using each differentiation rule above, confirming each function involved is differentiable.\\n    Now we have that f' is positive on the interior of D.\\n3. We argue f is continuous on D by noting that sums and products of continuous functions are continuous, and each term in the polynomial is continuous.\\n4. Now, with convexity, continuity, and positivity of the derivative established, we can conclude f is monotonic on D.\\nThis completes the proof.\"}"

To finish this step, show that each term in the derivative is positive for \\\\( x > 0 \\\\), then combine these to show the entire expression is strictly positive on the interior.\\n    2.4. Each time you use a differentiation rule, you must check that all functions being differentiated are differentiable at the appropriate points; this is straightforward for polynomials.\\n3. Next, show that f is continuous on D. Since it is a sum of continuous (polynomial) functions, it is straightforward to show this.\\n4. With all the above, conclude that f is monotone on D by appealing to a result ensuring monotonicity for functions whose derivatives are positive on a convex set and which are continuous.\\nNow we are done.\"}"

We will do so by first proving that D is convex. Then we will prove that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D. Then we will show that f is continuous on D. Finally, we can conclude it is monotonic on D.\\n1. We can prove D is convex by using the fact that any closed interval is convex.\\n2. To prove the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D, we proceed as follows:\\n    2.1. Assume x is in the interior of D, i.e., 0 < x < 10.\\n    2.2. Compute the derivative of f(x), which involves using differentiation rules repeatedly for each term of the sum. After simplification, you get an expression consisting of positive multiples of powers of x along with a positive constant.\\n    2.3. Show that each term in the derivative is positive for x > 0, and thus their sum is positive. Do this by showing each term as strictly positive given that x > 0, and that the constant term is also positive.\\n    2.4. For each differentiation rule used above, justify differentiability of each function/term at the relevant points.\\n3. Show that f is continuous on D by showing that each summand is continuous, and thus the sum is continuous, which is straightforward for polynomials.\\n4. Using all of the above, conclude that f is monotonic on D.\\nNow we are done.\"}"

need to show that the polynomial f(x) = 20 * x ^ 7 + 2 * x ^ 4 + 7 * x ^ 3 + 8 * x ^ 2 + 19 * x + 12 is monotonic on the set D = [0, 7]. We will do so by showing D is convex, f is continuous on D, and the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D. With these done, we can conclude monotonicity. The proof proceeds as follows:\\n1. Prove that D is convex.\\n    1.1. Any closed interval is convex, so this is immediate.\\n2. Prove that the derivative of f is positive on the interior of D.\\n    2.1. Assume that x is in the interior of D. That is, x satisfies 0 < x < 7.\\n    2.2. Compute f'(x) using the linearity of derivatives, product rule, and the usual rules for powers and constants. This will yield an expression of the form: 140 * x^6 + 8 * x^3 + 21 * x^2 + 16 * x + 19.\\n    2.3. Observe that each term in the above sum is strictly positive for x > 0. Decompose the proof to show that for each term:\\n        2.3.1. 140 * x^6 > 0 for x > 0.\\n        2.3.2. 8 * x^3 > 0 for x > 0.\\n        2.3.3. 21 * x^2 > 0 for x > 0.\\n        2.3.4. 16 * x > 0 for x > 0.\\n        2.3.5. 19 > 0 always.\\n    2.4. Conclude that the sum is positive on the interior of D by combining positivity of all terms.\\n    2.5. For each step of differentiation, justify the differentiability of each term in the polynomial.\\n3. Show that f is continuous on D.\\n    3.1. Each term in f(x) is a (constant times) power of x, or a constant, all of which are continuous. Thus, f is continuous as a sum of continuous functions.\\n4. Conclude that f is monotonic on D by appealing to the general result that a continuous function on a convex domain with strictly positive derivative in the interior is monotone on that domain.\\n\\nNow we are done.\"}"

The proof proceeds by establishing convexity, the strict positivity of the derivative on the interior, continuity, and then invokes a general result about monotonicity. The structure is as follows:\\n\\n1. First, we prove that the domain \\\\( D \\\\) is convex.\\n   1.1. This can be done by recalling that any closed interval in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) is convex.\\n2. Next, we show that the derivative of \\\\( f \\\\) is strictly positive on the interior of \\\\( D \\\\).\\n   2.1. Assume \\\\( x \\\\) lies in the interior of \\\\( D \\\\), i.e., \\\\( 0 < x < 4 \\\\).\\n   2.2. Compute the derivative of \\\\( f \\\\) by using differentiation rules for sums, products, and powers several times, yielding a sum of positive terms: \\\\( 42x^6 + 24x^5 + 35x^4 + 12x^3 + 45x^2 + 20x \\\\).\\n   2.3. Establish that each term in this sum is strictly positive for \\\\( x > 0 \\\\).\\n        2.3.1. For each term, argue that \\\\( x^n \\\\) is positive when \\\\( x > 0 \\\\), and thus all these multiples are positive.\\n        2.3.2. Conclude that adding these positive quantities yields a positive number.\\n   2.4. Recall that the validity of differentiation steps requires differentiability of the constituent functions; confirm that each monomial and constant is differentiable.\\n3. Now, we check that \\\\( f \\\\) is continuous on \\\\( D \\\\).\\n   3.1. Since polynomials are sums of continuous functions, and each monomial is continuous, their sum is continuous over \\\\( D \\\\).\\n4. Having shown strict positivity of the derivative in the interior, convexity of the domain, and continuity of \\\\( f \\\\), appeal to a general result on monotonicity of functions with positive derivatives on convex sets to conclude that \\\\( f \\\\) is monotone on \\\\( D \\\\).\\n\\nThus, the structure follows: check convexity \\u2192 show \\\\( f' > 0 \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) (break into terms, show each is positive) \\u2192 establish continuity \\u2192 conclude monotonicity.\"}"

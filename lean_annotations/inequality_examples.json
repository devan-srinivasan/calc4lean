        "annotation": "We aim to show that for two functions p(x), q(x), given that p(0) = q(0) > 0, and that p'(x) * q'(x) = 17 for all x in \nD = [0, 1] it holds that p(x) + 17 * q(x) > 34 * x, with the given assumptions that that p(x), and q(x) are differentiable over all real numbers, and that\np'(x) > 0 for all x. One idea to prove this is to show that the function f(x) = p(x) + 17 * q(x) - 34 * x is positive on D, as that is equivalent\nto what we want to show. We can prove that by showing f(0) > 0, and that f is monotonic on (0, 1). We can then conclude that f is positive, and then manipulate\nit to show our original inequality is true.\n\n1. Let f(x) = p(x) + 17 * q(x) - 34 * x\n2. We can prove that f(0) = 0 by straightforward substitution.\n3. Next we can show that f is monotonic on D using the following.\n    a. We show that f is differentiable over the reals, which follows using our assumptions about the differentiability of p and q, as well as differentiabiliy\n    rules. \n    b. We can then conclude f is differentiable on D since D is a subset of all real numbers\n    c. Since f is differentiable, we can conclude that it is continuous on D as well.\n    d. We can show that the derivative of f is nonnegative on the interior of D by the following method\n        i. We assume that x is in the interior of D, that is 0 < x < 1\n        ii. We substitute the q'(x) as 17/p'(x) using the fact that p'(x) > 0\n        iii. We apply standard differentiation rules to simplify the derivative to p'(x) + 17 * (17 / p'(x)) - 34\n        iv. We show that p'(x) + 17 * (17 / p'(x)) - 34 > 0 if and only if p'(x) * (p'(x) + 17 * (17 / p'(x)) - 34) > 0 using the fact that p'(x) > 0\n        v. We show that this expression can be factored into (p'(x) - 17)^2 > 0\n        vi. We then show that this is nonnegative using the fact that the square of anything is nonnegative\n        vii. Finally, as we used differentiation rules to simplify the derivatives, we show each constitutuent in the rules we applied are differentiability, to satisfy\n            valid use of those rules.\n    e. Finally, with these proven, we can conclude that f is monotonic on D\n4. Now we can prove that f is positive on D.\n    a. First we show that x is positive which is easy as we have the assumption that 0 < x < 1.\n    b. Then we show that f(x) > f(0) for x in D, which follows from our proof of monotonicity of f on D.\n    c. Then we conclude that f is positive on D.\n5. Finally we rearrange the terms of f being positive on D to show that we have proven our desired inequality. That is, p(x) + 17 * q(x) - 34 * x > 0 is equivalent to p(x) + 17 * q(x) > 34 * x\nNow we are done.\n\n"

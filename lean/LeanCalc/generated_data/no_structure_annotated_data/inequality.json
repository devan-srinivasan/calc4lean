        "annotation": "We want to show that under the given assumptions, the inequality p(x) + 17 * q(x) > 34 * x holds for all x in D = [0, 1]. A good approach is to consider the function f(x) = p(x) + 17 * q(x) - 34 * x and show f(x) > 0 for x \u2208 D. This proof splits into several pieces: showing positivity at 0, the monotonicity of f on D, that this implies f(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 D, and finally relating f(x) > 0 to the original inequality.  Define f(x) = p(x) + 17 * q(x) - 34 * x, and D to be the closed interval [0, 1]. Show that f(0) > 0 by direct substitution and by using the assumption that p(0) = q(0) and q(0) > 0. Show f is monotone on D: Argue that f is differentiable on \u211d using the differentiability of p, q, and basic differentiation rules. Conclude that f is differentiable on the interior of D and continuous on D by restriction. Show that the derivative f'(x) is nonnegative on the interior of D by: Expressing q'(x) in terms of p'(x) using the assumption that p'(x) * q'(x) = 17 and p'(x) > 0. Expanding the derivative f'(x) and simplifying algebraically. Reducing the condition to an expression involving only p'(x), and recognizing its nonnegativity due to being a square. Carefully noting the use of differentiation rules at every step, including justifications about differentiability where needed. Conclude using the above facts that f is monotone on D. Use monotonicity: Show that x \u2265 0 as x \u2208 D. Use monotonicity to deduce that f(x) \u2265 f(0). Use the earlier calculation that f(0) > 0 to conclude f(x) > 0. Finally, observe that f(x) > 0 is equivalent to the original statement p(x) + 17 * q(x) > 34 * x by straightforward rearrangement. Having established this chain, deduce the claim."

        "annotation": "We want to prove that under the provided assumptions\u2014such as p(0)=q(0), q(0)>0, p', q' positive/differentiable, and for all y, p'(y) * q'(y) = 200, as well as x in [0,1]\u2014 the inequality p(x) + 2 * q(x) > 40 * x holds. The strategy is to construct the function f(x) = p(x) + 2 * q(x) - 40 * x and show it is positive for all x in [0,1]. To do this, we will demonstrate that f(0) > 0, and that f is monotonic (non-decreasing) on [0,1]. This approach then allows us to relate everything back to the original inequality after simple algebraic manipulation.  Define f(x) = p(x) + 2 * q(x) - 40 * x and work on the domain D = [0,1]. Show that f(0) > 0: By substituting the value x = 0 into f and using p(0) = q(0), the computation is straightforward. We use that 1 + 1 = 2 and the positivity of q(0) to show this sum is greater than zero. Prove that f is monotonic (specifically, non-decreasing) on D: Show that f is differentiable, using the provided differentiability of p and q and standard differentiation rules for sums, scalar multiples, and the identity function. Conclude that f is differentiable on the interior of D, by restricting from the reals. Use differentiability to conclude f is continuous on D. Prove that the derivative of f is nonnegative on the interior of D, by: 3.4.1. Fix x2 in the interior of D. 3.4.2. Use the assumption on the product of p' and q' to express q'(x2) in terms of p'(x2). 3.4.3. Compute the derivative of f explicitly, applying the chain, sum, and product rule as needed. 3.4.4. Substitute q'(x2) as 200/p'(x2) and simplify. 3.4.5. Observe that positivity of p'(x2) allows us to multiply both sides of an inequality without changing the sign. 3.4.6. Show, after simplification, that you are left with a perfect square in the numerator, and so it is always nonnegative. 3.4.7. Verify all the necessary functions are differentiable at x2 to justify all steps. 3.5. Conclude, using these, that f is monotonic (in particular, non-decreasing) on D. Show f(x) > 0 for any x in D: Since x \u2208 [0,1], in particular x \u2265 0. Since f is non-decreasing and x \u2265 0 (so x is to the right of 0 in the interval), deduce that f(x) \u2265 f(0). Combine this with f(0) > 0 to conclude f(x) > 0. Note that f(x) > 0 is equivalent to the desired inequality, and conclude by restating the result in terms of p(x) + 2 * q(x) > 40 * x. This completes the proof."

        "annotation": "Our goal is to show that for two functions p(x) and q(x), given the assumptions p(0) = q(0), q(0) > 0, (p') * (q') = 18 everywhere, and p'(x) > 0, we have p(x) + 2q(x) > 12x for x in [0,1]. We will do this by showing that a function f(x) = p(x) + 2q(x) - 12x is strictly positive on [0,1]. The structure of the proof follows these steps:  Define the function f(x) = p(x) + 2q(x) - 12x and the interval D = [0, 1]. Show that f(0) > 0. Substitute x = 0 into f(x) and use the given values of p(0) and q(0). Use the hypothesis q(0) > 0 and basic arithmetic to conclude f(0) > 0. Show that f is monotonic (in fact, nondecreasing) on D. Show that f is differentiable on \u211d by applying differentiability rules to p and q and the various combinations. Restrict this to differentiability on the interior of D, using the differentiability already established. Use the differentiability of f to conclude f is continuous on D. Show that the derivative of f is nonnegative on the interior of D. 3.4.1. Fix an interior point x\u2082 \u2208 D and consider the derivative of f at x\u2082. 3.4.2. Substitute for q'(x\u2082) using the supplied relation between p' and q' and the fact that p'(x\u2082) > 0. 3.4.3. Compute the derivative using rules for different combinations (addition/scalar multiplication/difference). 3.4.4. Simplify to an inequality involving p'(x\u2082), showing nonnegativity is equivalent to a certain square being nonnegative. 3.4.5. Use the fact that squares are always nonnegative to finish this step. 3.4.6. Ensure that you have justified the various differentiability claims for all composed functions used. 3.5. Conclude monotonicity from the nonnegativity of the derivative on the interior of D, differentiability, and continuity. Show that f(x) > 0 for x \u2208 D. Use your previous result that f is nondecreasing to show f(x) \u2265 f(0) for x \u2208 D. Combine this with the already-proved f(0) > 0 to deduce f(x) > 0 everywhere in D. Conclude the original inequality holds for x \u2208 D by rearranging f(x) > 0 to p(x) + 2q(x) > 12x.  This argument uses the structure of monotonicity arguments: find f(0) > 0, show f is nondecreasing by differentiating and using the hypotheses, infer f(x) \u2265 f(0), and finish with the target inequality."

        "annotation": "We are asked to prove that, given two differentiable functions p and q with p' > 0 everywhere and p'(y) * q'(y) = 8 for all y, and p(0) = q(0) > 0, it holds that for any x \u2208 [0, 1], the expression p x + 2 * q x > 8 * x. We approach this by introducing an auxiliary function whose positivity encodes the desired statement, and then show it is positive on the relevant interval by combining initial value and monotonicity arguments.  Define f(x) = p(x) + 2 * q(x) - 8 * x. If we show f(x) > 0 for x \u2208 [0,1], the original claim is immediate. Prove f(0) > 0 by direct substitution, using p(0) = q(0) and q(0) > 0. Next, we show that f is monotonic (non-decreasing) on D = [0,1]. Show that f is differentiable everywhere, using the differentiability of p and q and application of standard differentiation rules. Deduce differentiability of f on the interior of D since it\u2019s differentiable everywhere. Conclude continuity of f on D because differentiability implies continuity. Prove that the derivative of f is nonnegative on the interior of D: 3.4.1. For any x in the interior of D, note that p'(x) > 0 from assumptions. 3.4.2. Express q'(x) as 8 / p'(x), justified by the relation p'(x) * q'(x) = 8. 3.4.3. Compute f'(x) using differentiation rules: f'(x) = p'(x) + 2 * q'(x) - 8. 3.4.4. Substitute q'(x) = 8 / p'(x) and simplify: f'(x) = p'(x) + 2 * (8 / p'(x)) - 8. 3.4.5. Show that f'(x) \u2265 0 is equivalent to (p'(x) - 4)^2 \u2265 0, which always holds. 3.4.6. Validate each step: substitution, application of differentiation formulas, and use the fact that the square of a real number is nonnegative. 3.5. Now, apply a general result: since f is continuous on a closed interval and its derivative is nonnegative on the interior, f is monotonic on D. Prove f(x) > 0 for x \u2208 D. First, x \u2208 [0,1], so x \u2265 0. As f is monotonic and x \u2265 0, f(x) \u2265 f(0). Since f(0) > 0, conclude f(x) > 0. Observe that f(x) > 0 is equivalent to p(x) + 2 * q(x) > 8 * x, which is the quantity we wanted.  Thus, the claim follows."

The proof uses monotonicity of a related function constructed from p and q and manipulations of derivatives.  Define the function f(x) = p(x) + 2 * q(x) - 28 * x. Show that f(0) > 0 by direct substitution: Substitute the assumptions at 0 for p(0) and q(0). Rearrange the resulting terms and use positivity of q(0) to show the result. Prove f is monotonic on D = [0, 1]: Show f is differentiable on \u211d by combining the differentiability of p and q, and via standard differentiation rules. Use the fact that f is differentiable on the interior of D, as differentiability passes to open subsets. Deduce continuity of f on D using the differentiability. Establish that the derivative of f is nonnegative on the interior of D. To do this: 3.4.1. Take any x2 in the interior of D. 3.4.2. Use the relationship between the derivatives of p and q, together with the positivity of deriv p, to express deriv q in terms of deriv p. 3.4.3. Apply differentiation rules and simplify the derivative of f using this substitution. 3.4.4. Rearrange the resulting inequality into a quadratic form and further into a perfect square. 3.4.5. Use positivity/squaring properties to conclude nonnegativity. 3.4.6. Justify each differentiation step by referencing differentiability of the components. 3.5.

One way to prove this statement is to introduce a function f(x) = p(x) + 3 * q(x) - 30 * x, and show that this function is positive on D = [0,1], which gives precisely the desired inequality.  Define f(x) = p(x) + 3 * q(x) - 30 * x and D = [0, 1]. Prove that f(0) > 0: Expanding f(0) with the given data, you can directly substitute using h0. Reduce the computation to a product of two positive numbers to show positivity. Next, show that f is monotonic on D: First, show f is differentiable on \u211d, using the differentiability assumptions on p, q, and arithmetic rules. Deduce that f is also differentiable on the open interval interior D since D \u2286 \u211d. Argue that f is continuous on D as a consequence of differentiability. Establish that the derivative of f is nonnegative on the interior of D: 3.4.1. Fix x2 \u2208 interior D. 3.4.2. By the assumption on p'(x2), manipulate the condition p'(x2) * q'(x2) = 75, and solve for q'(x2) in terms of p'(x2). 3.4.3. Use differentiation rules and plug in this replacement to compute f'(x2). 3.4.4. Reduce showing f'(x2) \u2265 0 to showing that (p'(x2) - 15)^2 \u2265 0, using algebraic manipulations. 3.4.5. Argue nonnegativity of the expression by recognizing it as a perfect square. 3.5. Conclude that monotonicity of f on D follows. Having monotonicity and a positive value at 0, deduce f(x) > 0 for x \u2208 D: Argue using monotonicity that f(x) \u2265 f(0) for x \u2208 D, with all assumptions in place.

        "annotation": "We are given differentiable functions p(x) and q(x) over \u211d, such that p(0) = q(0) and q(0) > 0, and for all y, (p'(y))(q'(y)) = 75, while p'(y) > 0 for all y. Our goal is to show that for x \u2208 [0, 1], we have p(x) + 3\u00b7q(x) > 30\u00b7x. The idea is to define an auxiliary function f(x) = p(x) + 3\u00b7q(x) - 30\u00b7x and prove that f(x) > 0 for x in [0, 1]. This will follow from f(0) > 0 and monotonicity of f on [0, 1], showing f is increasing and starts positive. The proof structure proceeds as follows:  Define f(x) = p(x) + 3\u00b7q(x) - 30\u00b7x, and let D = [0, 1]. Prove f(0) > 0. Substitute x = 0 into f. Use assumptions about p(0), q(0), and q(0) > 0 to show f(0) > 0 is true, by direct computation and multiplication positivity. Show that f is monotonic (non-decreasing) on D. Prove f is differentiable over \u211d using the differentiability of p, q, and linearity rules. Conclude f is differentiable on the interior of D by restriction, and hence continuous on D. Prove for all x2 \u2208 interior D, the derivative f'(x2) \u2265 0: Write out f'(x2) using the chain rule for derivatives. Use p'(x2) > 0 and the equation p'(x2) q'(x2) = 75 to express q'(x2) in terms of p'(x2). Substitute q'(x2) = 75 / p'(x2) into the expression for f'(x2) and simplify. Observe that the resulting inequality can be transformed to a perfect square being non-negative (namely, (p'(x2) - 15)\u00b2 \u2265 0). 3.3.5. Conclude f'(x2) \u2265 0 as a square is always non-negative. 3.3.6. Where differentiation rules were used, confirm the differentiability of the constituent functions at any relevant step. Apply a monotonicity result ensuring that f is monotonic on D, as the derivative is non-negative and f is continuous/differentiable on D. Show that f(x) > 0 for x \u2208 [0, 1]. Confirm that x \u2208 [0, 1], so x \u2265 0. Use the monotonicity of f on D to assert f(x) \u2265 f(0), and thus f(x) > 0 by earlier step. Observe that f(x) > 0 is equivalent to the original statement, p(x) + 3\u00b7q(x) > 30\u00b7x, by algebraic rearrangement. Conclude the proof."

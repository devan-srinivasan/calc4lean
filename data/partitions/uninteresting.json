The sum\n\nof the terms, by assumption, is zero, which means either all its terms are zero, or some two terms are of different signs. In any case, there exist integers $ a, b \\in \\langle 0; d-1 \\rangle $ such that $ g(a) \\leq 0 \\leq g(b) $. From the continuity of the function $ g $, it follows that there is a point $ x_0 $ in the interval with endpoints $ a $, $ b $ where it takes the value $ 0 $ (Darboux property). The equality $ g(x_0) = 0 $ is equivalent to $ f(x_0) = f(x_0+1) $. We have thus found a point $ x_0 \\in \\langle 0; d-1 \\rangle $, which is what we were looking for in the problem.\nNote: It is not difficult to show that the given theorem is not true for any number $ d > 1 $ that is not an integer. It suffices to take any function $ h \\colon \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} $ that is periodic with period $ 1 $, continuous, and such that $ h(0) = 0 $, $ h(d) = d $, and set $ f(x) = h(x)-x $. The function thus defined satisfies the condition $ f(0) = f(d) $, but does not satisfy the equality $ f(x) = f (x +1) $ for any $ x $; such an equality would imply that $ h(x+1) = h(x) + 1 $, which contradicts the periodicity of the function $ h $.",

The corresponding term of the sequence will be exactly $\\frac{p}{q}$.\n\nIn fact, each rational number will appear in our sequence an infinite number of times, since a rational number can be represented in an infinite number of ways as $\\frac{p}{q}$ (for example, $\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{4}{6}=\\frac{6}{9}=\\frac{8}{12}=\\ldots$). However, it is not so easy to explicitly specify the position of each rational number in the sequence. Try, for example, to find the positions of the numbers $1 \\frac{1}{3}, -\\frac{5}{7}, 10$.

Differential Equations Admitting Order Reduction\n\nWe will indicate some types of differential equations that admit order reduction.\n\n1. Equations of the form $y^{(n)}=f(x)$. After $n$-fold integration, the general solution is obtained:\n\n$$\ny=\\underbrace{\\int \\ldots \\int}_{n} f(x) \\underbrace{d x \\ldots d x}_{n}+C_{1} \\frac{x^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}+C_{2} \\frac{x^{n-2}}{(n-2)!}+\\ldots+C_{n-1} x+C_{n}\n$$\n\nII. Equations that do not contain the unknown function and its derivatives up to order $k-1$ inclusive:\n\n$$\nF\\left(x, y^{(k)}, y^{(k+1)}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nThe order of such an equation can be reduced by $k$ units by the substitution $y^{(k)}(x)=p(x)$. Then the equation takes the form\n\n$$\nF\\left(x, p, p^{\\prime}, \\ldots, p^{(n-k)}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nFrom the last equation, if possible, we determine $p=f\\left(x, C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n-k}\\right)$, and then we find $y$ from the equation $y^{(k)}=f\\left(x, C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n-k}\\right)$ by $k$-fold integration.\n\nIII. Equations that do not contain the independent variable:\n\n$$\nF\\left(y, y^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime \\prime}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nThe substitution $y^{\\prime}=p$ allows reducing the order of the equation by one unit. Here, $p$ is considered as a new unknown function of $y$: $p=p(y)$. All derivatives $y^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime \\prime}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}$ are expressed in terms of derivatives of the new unknown function $p$ with respect to $y$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y^{\\prime}=\\frac{d y}{d x}=p \\\\\n& y^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{d p}{d x}=\\frac{d p}{d y} \\frac{d y}{d x}=p \\frac{d p}{d y} \\\\\n& y^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}=\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(p \\frac{d p}{d y}\\right)=\\frac{d}{d y}\\left(p \\frac{d p}{d y}\\right) \\frac{d y}{d x}=p^{2} \\frac{d^{2} p}{d y^{2}}+p\\left(\\frac{d p}{d y}\\right)^{2} \\text { and so on. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $y^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime \\prime}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}$ into the equation, we obtain a differential equation of order $(n-1)$.\n\nIV. Equations $F\\left(x, y, y^{\\prime}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}\\right)=0$, homogeneous with respect to the arguments $y, y^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime \\prime}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F}\\left(x, t y, t y^{\\prime}, \\ldots, t y^{(n)}\\right)=t^{k} F\\left(x, y, y^{\\prime}, \\ldots, y^{(n)}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe order of such an equation can be reduced by one unit by the substitution $y=e^{\\int z d x}$, where $z$ is a new unknown function of $x: z=z(x)$.\n\nV. Equations written in differentials,\n\n$$\nF\\left(x, y, d x, d y, d^{2} y, \\ldots, d^{(n)} y\\right)=0\n$$\n\nwhere the function $F$ is homogeneous with respect to its arguments $x, y, d x$, $d y, d^{2} y, \\ldots, d^{n} y$, if we consider $x$ and $d x$ to be of the first dimension, and $y, d y, d^{2} y$ and so on to be of dimension $m$. Then $\\frac{d y}{d x}$ will have dimension $m-1, \\frac{d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}$ will have dimension $m-2$, and so on.\n\nTo reduce the order, the substitution $x=e^{t}, y=u e^{m t}$ is applied. As a result, we obtain a differential equation between $u$ and $t$ that does not explicitly contain $t$, i.e., it admits a reduction of order by one unit (case III).\n\nWe will consider examples for various cases of order reduction of a differential equation.",

Boundary Value Problems\n\nConsider, for simplicity, a second-order equation\n\n\\[\ny'' + p_1(x) y' + p_2(x) y = 0\n\\]\n\nThe coefficients \\( p_1(x) \\) and \\( p_2(x) \\) will be considered continuous in some interval \\((a, b)\\). Then each solution \\( y(x) \\) of equation (1) will be defined throughout this interval. In the future, instead of equation (1), we will consider an equation of the form\n\n\\[\n\\left[p(x) y'\\right]' + q(x) y = 0, \\quad p(x) > 0\n\\]\n\nEquations (1) and (2) can be transformed into each other. Equations of the form (2) are called self-adjoint.\n\nThe solution of the differential equation\n\n\\[\n\\left[p(x) y'\\right]' + q(x) y = 0\n\\]\n\nis completely determined by the initial conditions \\( y(x_0) = y_0, y'(x_0) = y_0' \\). However, in many physical problems, it is necessary to find solutions defined in a different way. For example, the problem may be to find a solution of equation (2) that takes on specified values \\( y(a) \\) and \\( y(b) \\) at points \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Usually, in such cases, the values of the solution are sought only for \\( x \\) in \\((a, b)\\). Thus, the specified values \\( y(a) \\) and \\( y(b) \\) are at the ends of the interval, so problems of this kind are called boundary value problems. In the future, we will base our interval on \\((0, \\pi)\\) (the main interval), which does not reduce the generality of the arguments.\n\nThe general form of boundary conditions for a second-order equation is as follows:\n\n\\[\nh_0 y(0) + h_1 y'(0) = A, \\quad k_0 y(\\pi) + k_1 y'(\\pi) = B\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h_0, h_1, k_0, k_1, A, B \\) are given constants, and \\( h_0, h_1, k_0, k_1 \\) are not all zero simultaneously.\n\nIf \\( A = B = 0 \\), the boundary conditions are called homogeneous, for example:\n\n1) \\( y(0) = y(\\pi) = 0 \\)\n2) \\( h_0 y(0) = y'(0), \\quad y'(\\pi) = -h_1 y(\\pi); \\quad h_0, h_1 > 0 \\),\n3) \\( y'(0) = y'(\\pi) = 0 \\)\n4) \\( y(0) = y(\\pi), \\quad y'(0) = y'(\\pi) \\).\n\nIn general, boundary value problems are not always solvable, i.e., there does not always exist a solution that takes on the required values at the ends of the interval. For example, the boundary value problem\n\n\\[\ny'' = 0, \\quad y(0) - y(\\pi) = 1, \\quad y'(0) + y'(\\pi) = 0\n\\]\n\nhas no solution. The problem\n\n\\[\ny'' + \\lambda y = 0, \\quad y(0) = y(\\pi) = 0\n\\]\n\nhas a non-zero solution only for integer values of \\(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\). Indeed, from the general solution of the differential equation (4)\n\n\\[\ny = C_1 e^{\\sqrt{-\\lambda x}} + C_2 e^{-\\sqrt{-\\lambda x}}\n\\]\n\nit follows that the boundary conditions are satisfied if and only if \\(\\lambda = n^2\\) is the square of an integer \\( n \\). The corresponding solutions are the functions \\( y_n = \\sin nx \\).\n\nAs can be seen from this example, if \\( q \\) in equation (2) is a function of the parameter \\(\\lambda\\), then for known conditions, there exist values of the parameter for which the homogeneous boundary value problem for equation (2) has a non-zero solution. These values of \\(\\lambda\\) are called eigenvalues, and the corresponding solutions of the boundary value problem are called eigenfunctions. The latter are defined up to an arbitrary constant factor. Thus, for the boundary value problem \\( y'' + \\lambda y = 0, y(0) = y(\\pi) = 0 \\), the numbers \\( 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \\ldots \\) and the functions \\( \\sin x, \\sin 2x, \\ldots \\) are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, respectively.\n\nIn addition to simple eigenvalues, where one eigenvalue corresponds to one eigenfunction (up to a constant factor), there are multiple eigenvalues, where an eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_0\\) corresponds to two or more linearly independent eigenfunctions.\n\nWhen solving boundary value problems (for linear homogeneous differential equations), the following approach is taken: find the general solution of the given differential equation\n\n\\[\ny = C_1 y_1(x) + C_2 y_2(x) + \\ldots + C_n y_n(x)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( y_1(x), y_2(x), \\ldots, y_n(x) \\) are linearly independent solutions. Then require that this solution \\( y(x) \\) satisfies the given boundary conditions. This leads to a certain linear system of equations for determining \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\). By solving this system, if possible, find the solution of the given boundary value problem. In this process, if the problem of finding eigenvalues arises, the condition for the existence of a non-zero solution of the system determining \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\) is the condition that determines the eigenvalues. This is generally a transcendental equation for \\(\\lambda\\).",

Let $d$ be a $k$-digit number.\n\na) The numbers from A890...0 to A9...9 ($k+2$ nines) all contain nines. There are more than $d$ such numbers. The distance between two consecutive groups of such numbers is $89 \\cdot 10^{k} \\leq 89 d$. Therefore, the number of terms in the sequence is no more than 90.\nb) When transitioning from any term of the sequence to the next, i.e., by adding the number $d$, the $(k+1)$-th digit either remains unchanged or increases by 1 (the digit 9 is forbidden, so the case of changing from 9 to 0 is excluded). If there are no transitions with a change in the $(k+1)$-th digit in the progression, then the number of terms in the progression is no more than 9. Suppose such transitions exist. Since the digit 9 is forbidden, there are no more than 8 such transitions. Between two such transitions, as well as before the first and after the last, there are groups (which may be empty) of transitions without changing the $(k+1)$-th digit. There are a total of 9 such groups.\n\nConsider the term of the progression that stands before a transition that changes the $(k+1)$-th digit.

Solution Straightforward to get the basic idea, but care is needed with the details. It is quite hard to get the answer exactly right (the official solution gives a spurious solution for the case (2) - overlooking the problem with the integration limits).",
            "solution": ": (1) No solutions for \u03b1 = 0; (2) No solutions for \u03b1  0 and not of the form p/q, with p and q odd positive integers, f = A e kx , where A is any real, and k is the positive real value of \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) ; (5) For \u03b1 = p/q, with p and q odd positive integers (but not both 1), f = A e kx or A e -kx , where A is any real, and k is the positive real value of \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) . Case (3) is obvious. Case (1) is almost obvious: if \u03b1 = 0, then the lhs varies with y ( = y - b), but the rhs does not ( = 1), so there are no solutions. Assume now that \u03b1 is not 0 or 1. Differentiate wrt y and put g(y) = \u222b b y f(x) dx. Then f = g' and we have f \u03b1 = \u03b1 g \u03b1 -1 f. So f = k g, where k = \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) . Since f = g', we can integrate immediately to get f(x) = A e kx (*). However, we have to consider how many real values k can have. If \u03b1 > 0, then k certainly has a positive value, but we can also take the corresponding negative value if 1/(\u03b1 - 1) involves an even root, in other words if \u03b1 = p/q with p and q both odd. Finally, (*) is clearly necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, so we have to subsitute (*) back into the original equation. For k > 0, we find the solution works provided b = -\u221e. If k < 0, then it works with b = \u221e. This gives cases (4) and (5). [Note, however, that we can only allow A negative for \u03b1 not of the form p/q with p and q odd, provided we are content for both sides of the original equation to have complex values (even though f is real valued).] For \u03b1 < 0, all values of \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) are complex unless \u03b1 = - p/q with p an even positive integer and q an odd positive integer. If \u03b1 has that form, then we may take k = - 1/|\u03b1| 1/(|\u03b1|+1) . But now there is a problem with b. Taking A = 1 for simplicity, the f \u03b1 (x) = e |\u03b1k|x , so the lhs = const (e |\u03b1k|y - e |\u03b1k|b ) and the rhs = const /(e - |k|y - e - |k|b ) |\u03b1| . The constants are the same, but we need b = -\u221e to get rid of the b term on the lhs and b = \u221e to get rid of the term on the rhs.

Then the given equation becomes y 2 /x 2 = by', where b = f(0). Integrating, b/y = c + 1/x, or y = bx/(cx + 1). Differentiating gives f(x) = y' = b/(cx + 1) 2 . f(-1/c) is undefined, so if K is the half-line, then c cannot be negative. If K is the finite interval [0, a), then we require c \u2265 -1/a. Note that we can have equality because k must be strictly less than a. On the other hand, b can have any value. Note that if we start by differentiating, then things get somewhat messy, albeit manageable. We get: x y' = A y 3/2 - 2y, where A = 2/\u221a f(0). So we have to integrate 1/(A y 3/2 - 2y).

Solution",
            "solution": ": no. Straightforward. We look first at (2). We know that \u2207x F = 0 iff F = \u2207 g for some g: R 3 \u2192R. Remembering that tan -1 k has derivative 1/(1 + k 2 ) and playing around a little, we soon hit on g(x, y, z) = 1/2 tan -1 (2y/x) + h(z). That looks promising. In fact, it almost works. We might, for example take h(z) = 1/2 z 2 , so that F(x, y, z) = (- y/(x 2 + 4y 2 ), x/(x 2 + 4y 2 ), z). That satisfies (2) and (3), and almost satisfies (1). The difficulty is that it, and its partial derivatives wrt x and y, are discontinuous (and arguably undefined) on the entire line x = 0, y = 0 (not just at the origin). So we suspect that we cannot find F to satisfy all the conditions. The obvious approach is to assume we can and to seek a contradiction using Stokes' theorem ( \u222b S \u2207x F . d a = \u222b \u0393 F. d s , where S is a surface bounded by a closed curve \u0393 ). We want S to cut the z axis at z \u2260 0, because we believe the discontinuities are on the z-axis and so that will ensure that the surface integral is non-zero, whereas (2) would imply that it was zero. We want a curve \u0393 on which the line integral is easy to calculate. It clearly must lie entirely within the x, y plane (so that we can use (3) to give us F - otherwise we do not know what F is). It also looks sensible to take an ellipse x 2 + 4y 2 = k, because then f is drastically simplified. The line integral is then \u222b \u0393 F. d s = \u222b \u0393 f. d s = \u222b \u0393 (-y dx + x dy)/k = 2/k area ellipse \u2260 0. If (2) was satisfied, then the surface integral would be zero, since the surface avoids the origin. Contradiction. 48th Putnam 1987 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 7 Oct 1999",

Also ln ln n 2 = ln ln n + ln 2  N so that ln ln x = a multiple of 2 \u03c0, then we can find at least N 2 /2 consecutive integers n in the range x to x 2 such that (A) 1/ln n > 1/(2 ln N) and (B) ln ln n lies between 2k \u03c0 and 2k \u03c0 + \u03c0/3 (for some integer k) and hence so that cos ln ln n > 1/2. Hence for each such integer (cos ln ln n)/ln n > 1/(4 ln N). So \u2211 (cos ln ln n)/ln n over all these terms is at least N 2 /(8 ln N) which can be made arbitrarily large. Hence the sequence does not converge. (2) ax 2 + 2bxy + cy 2 = h is the equation of an ellipse. If we rotate the axes to line up with its axes we get new coordinates X, Y so that it becomes AX 2 + BY 2 = h with AB = ac - b 2 .

Now take u = r cos \u03b8, v = r sin \u03b8 and we get 1/\u221a(ac - b 2 ) \u222b U (k + u 2 + v 2 ) -2 du dv = 1/\u221a(ac - b 2 ) \u222b U (k + r 2 ) -2 r dr d\u03b8 = 2 \u03c0 /\u221a(ac - b 2 ) \u222b (k + r 2 ) -2 r dr = 2 \u03c0 /(k \u221a(ac - b 2 ) ) \u222b (1 + s 2 ) -2 s ds = \u03c0 /(k \u221a(ac - b 2 ) ) (-1/(1 + s 2 )| 0 inf = 2 \u03c0 /(k \u221a(ac - b 2 ) ).

Define h n to agree with f on M n and to be horizontally interpolated elsewhere, so if x = m/2 n + x' , where 0 \u2264 x'  0, we may take \u03b4 > 0 so that points on L within \u03b4 of P are taken by f to points within \u03b5 of f(P). Take n sufficiently large so that the there are adjacent lines of M n flanking P and closer than \u03b4 to it. Let these lines cut L at Q and R. Then h n (P) lies between the values of f(Q) and f(R) and hence within \u03b5 of f(P). It remains to show that h n is continuous. This is slightly tricky to nail down rigorously.Take any point P = (x 0 , y 0 ) and any \u03b5 > 0. We need to show that h n takes poins close to P to values close to h n (P). Let L be the horizontal line through P. Assume that P does not lie on a line of M n , so take H to be the first line to the left of P, and K the first to the right of P. Let H meet L at Q, and K meet L at R. Note that the separation of Q and R is non-zero and fixed, so the values f(Q) and f(R) may differ by a large amount. But we may take \u03b4 > 0 so that points on H within \u03b4 of Q are taken by f to values within \u03b5/2 of f(Q) and points on K within \u03b4 of R are taken by f to values within \u03b5/2 of f(R). We want to show that for sufficiently small \u03b4 ' > 0, h n takes points inside the rectangle |x - x 0 | < \u03b4 ' , |y - y 0 | < \u03b4 to values within \u03b5 of h n (P). It is now easiest to think geometrically. Let us retain the x-axis to represent values of x, but now use the y-axis to represent possible values of h n . So at Q we have a vertical bar height \u03b5 centred on f(Q) and at R we have another vertical bar height \u03b5 centred on f(R). Joining the tops of these bars and joining the bottoms gives a parallelogram. A vertical line through this parallelogram at x gives the possible values of h n (x, y), where |y - y 0 | < \u03b4 (because to get that value we must interpolate linearly between some point on the left-hand edge of the parallelogram and some point on the right-hand edge). Now suppose the top and bottom edges of the parallelogram make an angle \u03b8 with the y-axis. Then a thin vertical slice of the parallelogram centred on y 0 width \u03b4 ' will project onto a segment length \u03b5 + \u03b4 ' cot \u03b8. By taking \u03b4 ' sufficiently small we can make this less than 2\u03b5. In other words the spread of values of h n (x, y) for |x - x 0 | < \u03b4 ' and |y - y 0 | < \u03b4 is less than 2\u03b5, which is the statement that h n is continuous. Finally, note that if P lies on a line of M n , then we can deal separately with points to the left and right of P, using the same argument. Comments. (1) It is easy to botch the argument that h n is continuous. But having said that, my argument does seem rather complicated. Can anyone see a simpler argument? Or indeed a better choice of h n to make the whole argument simpler? (2) Note that for the particular h n we have chosen, tending to f pointwise needs f(x, y) continuous in x, whilst continuity needs f(x, y) continuous in y. 35th Putnam 1974 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 18 Aug 2001",

What special property do the functions characterized by the last expression have in terms of convexity? Are there any other functions with similar properties?",
            "solution": "In our previous announcement, we saw that the validity of certain inequalities is geometrically evident from the fact that the curve of a certain function is convex or concave when viewed from below. For simpler functions, this can easily be determined by graphically representing the function. Let's consider, for example, the $\\sqrt{x}$ function. This is only defined for positive $x$ values. Its curve is the upper half of a parabola with a horizontal axis, so it is (when viewed from below) a concave curve. The $-\\sqrt{x}$ function, on the other hand, is represented by the lower half of the same parabola, so it is a convex curve.\n\nWhen plotting the $\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}$ function, it is necessary to calculate function values densely for numbers with very small absolute values to draw a reliable curve. Then we notice that as it approaches the value of $x=0$, the curve approaches the upper part of the $Y$-axis from both the left and the right. Thus, the curve is concave for negative $x$ values as well as for positive $x$ values, but we cannot say that the entire curve is concave because it has a vertex at $x=0$.\n\nThe $\\sqrt{x^{3}}$ function is again only defined for positive $x$ values, and for these, it is represented by a curved curve that approaches the $X$-axis near the $Y$-axis.\n\nAs we know, the image of the $\\frac{1}{x}$ curve is a hyperbola with equal legs, whose two branches approach the $X$-axis for $x$ values with large absolute values; for $x$ values close to 0 and negative, it approaches the lower part of the $Y$-axis, and for positive $x$ values, the upper part. The branch of the curve corresponding to negative $x$ values is concave, and the one corresponding to positive $x$ values is convex.\n\nEssentially, the same situation applies to the $\\frac{1}{x^{3}}$ function, with the only difference being that its curve approaches the $X$-axis much faster and the $Y$-axis much slower than the $\\frac{1}{x}$ curve. However, this does not change the fact that the curve is convex or concave.\n\nThe curve of $2^{x}$ and $10^{x}$ also approaches the $X$-axis for negative $x$ values, is 1 at 0, and increases more and more rapidly for positive $x$ values. The two function curves have a similar course; the only difference is that $10^{x}$ increases more strongly everywhere than $2^{x}$. This is also true for the curve of any power of a base greater than 1. The closer the base is to 1, the less steeply the function will rise. The power of 1 is always 1. The function $y=1^{x}=1$ is therefore represented by a horizontal line. If, however, the base is a positive number less than 1, then its positive powers approach 0, and its negative powers grow beyond all bounds if we increase the absolute value of the exponent beyond all bounds. The curves are now the mirror images of the curves corresponding to bases greater than 1 on the $Y$-axis. All such curves are convex.\n\nThe curve of $\\lg x$ rises steeply from large negative $y$ values for small positive $x$ values, intersects the $X$ axis at $x=1$, and then rises less and less steeply. The curve is concave everywhere.\n\nThe curves of $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ are represented by waves. The wave crests are concave, and the troughs are convex. Thus, the former is concave in the intervals $0 \\leq x \\leq \\pi$, $2 \\pi \\leq x \\leq 3 \\pi$, generally $2 k \\pi \\leq x \\leq(2 k+1) \\pi$, and convex in the intervals $\\pi \\leq x \\leq 2 \\pi$, $3 \\pi \\leq x \\leq 4 \\pi$, generally $(2 k+1) \\pi \\leq x \\leq(2 k+2) \\pi$; the latter is concave in the intervals $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leq x \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $\\frac{3 \\pi}{2} \\leq x \\leq \\frac{5 \\pi}{2}$, and generally $\\frac{4 k-1}{2} \\pi \\leq x \\leq \\frac{4 k+1}{2} \\pi$, and convex in the intervals $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leq x \\leq \\frac{3 \\pi}{2}$, $\\frac{5 \\pi}{2} \\leq x \\leq \\frac{7 \\pi}{2}$, and generally $\\frac{4 k+1}{2} \\pi \\leq x \\leq \\frac{4 k+3}{2} \\pi$ $(k=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots)$.\n\nFunctions of the form $a x+b$ have a special role in terms of convexity, as they are represented by a straight line, so they are neither convex nor concave. In a broader sense, however, they can be considered both convex and concave. No other function can have this property, only one whose image is a straight line.",

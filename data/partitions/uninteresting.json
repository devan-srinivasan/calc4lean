Solution Straightforward to get the basic idea, but care is needed with the details. It is quite hard to get the answer exactly right (the official solution gives a spurious solution for the case (2) - overlooking the problem with the integration limits).",
            "solution": ": (1) No solutions for \u03b1 = 0; (2) No solutions for \u03b1  0 and not of the form p/q, with p and q odd positive integers, f = A e kx , where A is any real, and k is the positive real value of \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) ; (5) For \u03b1 = p/q, with p and q odd positive integers (but not both 1), f = A e kx or A e -kx , where A is any real, and k is the positive real value of \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) . Case (3) is obvious. Case (1) is almost obvious: if \u03b1 = 0, then the lhs varies with y ( = y - b), but the rhs does not ( = 1), so there are no solutions. Assume now that \u03b1 is not 0 or 1. Differentiate wrt y and put g(y) = \u222b b y f(x) dx. Then f = g' and we have f \u03b1 = \u03b1 g \u03b1 -1 f. So f = k g, where k = \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) . Since f = g', we can integrate immediately to get f(x) = A e kx (*). However, we have to consider how many real values k can have. If \u03b1 > 0, then k certainly has a positive value, but we can also take the corresponding negative value if 1/(\u03b1 - 1) involves an even root, in other words if \u03b1 = p/q with p and q both odd. Finally, (*) is clearly necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, so we have to subsitute (*) back into the original equation. For k > 0, we find the solution works provided b = -\u221e. If k < 0, then it works with b = \u221e. This gives cases (4) and (5). [Note, however, that we can only allow A negative for \u03b1 not of the form p/q with p and q odd, provided we are content for both sides of the original equation to have complex values (even though f is real valued).] For \u03b1 < 0, all values of \u03b1 1/(\u03b1 -1) are complex unless \u03b1 = - p/q with p an even positive integer and q an odd positive integer. If \u03b1 has that form, then we may take k = - 1/|\u03b1| 1/(|\u03b1|+1) . But now there is a problem with b. Taking A = 1 for simplicity, the f \u03b1 (x) = e |\u03b1k|x , so the lhs = const (e |\u03b1k|y - e |\u03b1k|b ) and the rhs = const /(e - |k|y - e - |k|b ) |\u03b1| . The constants are the same, but we need b = -\u221e to get rid of the b term on the lhs and b = \u221e to get rid of the term on the rhs. So there are no solutions in case (2). 3rd Putnam 1940 \u00a9 John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 14 Sep 1999",

        "llm_response": "This problem involves multiple parts, each requiring some calculations or reasoning based on integrals, limits, and properties of series. Let's break down the classification:\n\n1. **Finding \\( a_1 \\)**:\n   - This involves computing an integral, which requires straightforward calculation and differentiation knowledge, fitting into the category of direct computation. \u2192 **EASY**\n\n2. **Expressing \\( a_{n+1} \\) in terms of \\( a_n \\)**:\n   - This also involves manipulating an integral and deriving a relation, which could be seen as straightforward if the necessary transformations are understood, however, it is not merely executing a calculation as it involves deriving a recursive form. \u2192 **MEDIUM**\n\n3. **Finding \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} a_n \\)**:\n   - This part makes use of properties of sequences and limits which fall into reasoning about convergence and boundedness, rather than computation directly. The process to derive the limit is generally straightforward but does require setting up and solving equations derived from the earlier parts. \u2192 **MEDIUM**\n\n4. **Finding \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2k-1} \\)**:\n   - This also involves knowledge about series convergence and the behavior of the alternating series, which needs an understanding of convergence properties but not formal proving as the result is well-known. \u2192 **MEDIUM**\n\nOverall, while parts marked as EASY can be computed directly, the remaining parts require a mix of computations and understanding limits and convergence, leaning towards MEDIUM difficulty. However, since they can be put into formal language and verified systematically, they remain interesting.\n\nTherefore, the classification would be:\n\n- (1) **EASY**\n- (2) **MEDIUM**\n- (3) **MEDIUM**\n- (4) **MEDIUM** \n\nThe overall problem is a combination of EASY and MEDIUM elements, with no part being uninteresting.",

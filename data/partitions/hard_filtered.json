For the constructed triangle $AB''C$, point $M$ will lie on the circumcircle of triangle $A_1BC_1$, since the relation $KC_1^2=KM \\cdot KB$ will be satisfied.\n\nComment. The relation $(b/2)^2=m^2/3$ can also be obtained in another way. If $D$ is the point symmetric to $B$ with respect to point $K$, then $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, so $\\angle DAH=\\angle DCH=90^\\circ$, and, moreover, $\\angle DMH=180^\\circ-\\angle BMH=90^\\circ$. Therefore, points $A$, $C$, and $M$ lie on the circle constructed on $DH$ as the diameter. Hence, $AK \\cdot KC=MK \\cdot KD$, from which the required relation follows.",

It is known that while Vasya was descending, they were at the same height exactly 4 times, including the moment when Vasya landed and the Ferris wheel cabin was at the bottom. Considering Vasya and Misha as points, find the rate of change of Misha's height at the moment they first reached the same height.\n\nThis problem allows for an intuitive solution based on the consideration of the graphs of the height changes of Misha and Vasya.\n\nThe graph of the height change of Vasya is a straight line $L$, and that of Misha is a sine wave (see Fig. 14). At the moment of Vasya's landing, the sine wave touches the $t$-axis, so \"to the left\" of the landing moment, the line $L$ is \"above\" the sine wave. Moving along $L$ to the left, if the next common point with the sine wave is a point of tangency, there will be no more common points (see Fig. 15). If not, then $L$ will be below the sine wave, and after the next common point, it will be above again. There is one common point left, so it is a point of tangency, and the rate of change of Misha's height at this moment is equal to the rate of change of Vasya's height, which is $3 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{c}$.\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_562c0940e9bf5ec7656bg-23.jpg?height=316&width=1026&top_left_y=822&top_left_x=212)\n\nFig. 14\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_562c0940e9bf5ec7656bg-23.jpg?height=308&width=583&top_left_y=1196&top_left_x=442)\n\nFig. 15",

By the definition of a limit, there exists a number $k$ such that for $n > k$ the inequality $\\left|x_{n} - a\\right| < \\varepsilon$ holds. This means that for $n > k$ the term $x_{n}$ is closer to point $a$ than the nearest end of the given segment. Therefore, all terms with indices greater than $k$ lie outside this segment. Hence, the given segment cannot contain an infinite number of terms of the sequence.\n\nb) For the sequence $1; \\frac{1}{2}; 3; \\frac{1}{4}; \\ldots; n^{(-1)^{n-1}}; \\ldots$, any segment centered at point 0 is a \"feeding ground.\" Indeed, the subsequence composed of terms with even indices $\\frac{1}{2}; \\frac{1}{4}; \\frac{1}{6}; \\ldots; \\frac{1}{2n}; \\ldots$ obviously tends to zero. Therefore, in any segment centered at point 0, there is an infinite number of terms of this subsequence (see the solution to problem 114a)). Hence, this segment is a feeding ground for the original sequence. Now, let's show that no segment not containing point 0 is a feeding ground. Indeed, for the subsequence composed of terms with even indices, this segment is not a feeding ground (see the solution to problem 114a)); for the subsequence composed of terms with odd indices $1; 3; 5; 7; \\ldots$, no segment can be a feeding ground (prove this independently). Therefore, on any segment not containing point 0, there will be only a finite number of terms with even indices and a finite number of terms with odd indices. Hence, on this segment, there is a finite number of terms of the sequence, and thus the segment is not a feeding ground.\n\nThus, the sequence $x_{n} = n^{(-1)^{n-1}}$ and the number 0 satisfy the conditions of problem 114b). However, the number 0 is not a limit of the sequence. Indeed, otherwise, for all terms of the sequence starting from some index, the condition $\\left|x_{n}\\right| < 1$ would hold. However, this inequality does not hold for all terms with odd indices.\n\n3 Remark.

For example, to construct an example of a sequence for which each of two given segments is a feeding ground (see problem 1096), one can combine two sequences, for one of which the first segment is a feeding ground, and for the other, the second segment is a feeding ground.",

            "solution": "257. a) First of all, note that if $x_{0}$ is a root of the equation, then $-x_{0}$ is also a root. Therefore, the number of negative roots is the same as the number of positive roots. Furthermore, the number 0 is a root of the equation. Thus, it is sufficient to find the number of positive roots. Now, let's note that if $\\frac{x}{100}=\\sin x$, then\n\n$$\n|x|=100|\\sin x| \\leqslant 100 \\cdot 1=100\n$$\n\nWe obtain that the root of the equation cannot have an absolute value greater than 100.\n\nDivide the segment of the $O x$ axis from $x=0$ to $x=100$ into segments of length $2 \\pi$ (the last segment may be shorter) and count the number of roots of our equation on each of these segments. Refer to Fig. 29.\n\nOn the first segment (from 0 to $2 \\pi$), there is one positive root (and one root zero), on each subsequent segment, except the last one, there are two roots. To determine the number of roots on the last segment, let's estimate its size: $\\frac{100}{2 \\pi}$ is obviously between 15 and $16\\left(\\frac{100}{15}=6.66 \\ldots>2 \\pi ; \\quad \\frac{100}{16}=6.255>\\pi \\right)$; therefore, on this segment, a complete positive half-wave of the sine wave fits and, thus, there are also two roots on it.\n\nThus, we have $1+14 \\cdot 2+2=31$ positive roots of our equation. There are as many negative roots, and one root is zero.\n\nFinally, the total number of roots is $31 \\cdot 2+1=63$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-282.jpg?height=199&width=908&top_left_y=365&top_left_x=120)\n\nFig. 29.\n\nb) The solution to this problem is analogous to the solution of part a). First of all, it is obvious that if $\\sin x=\\lg x$, then $x \\leqslant 10$ (otherwise, the left side of our equality is no more than 1, while the right side is greater). Since $2 \\cdot 2 \\pi>10$, on the segment of the $O x$ axis from $x=0$ to $x=10$, one complete wave of the sine curve $y=\\sin x$ and part of the next wave fit (Fig. 30).

Further, since $2 \\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\lg x$ and, thus, the graph of $y=\\lg x$ intersects the first half of the second positive half-wave; since $\\lg x=1>\\sin x$ at the point $x=10$, it must intersect the second half of this half-wave as well. Thus, we conclude that the equation $\\sin x=\\lg x$ has a total of three roots.",

            "solution": "Solution. We will use the symmetry of the astroid relative to the coordinate axes (Fig. 2.10). The desired volume $V$ is the difference between the volumes $V_{1}-V_{2}$ of two bodies. The first is obtained by rotating the arc $A B C$ of the astroid, and the second by rotating the arc $A D C$ around the line $y=-a$. In this case,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& V_{1}=2 \\pi \\int_{0}^{a}\\left(y_{1}+a\\right)^{2} d x \\\\\n& V_{2}=2 \\pi \\int_{0}^{a}\\left(y_{2}+a\\right)^{2} d x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{1}=y=a \\sin ^{3} t, t \\in\\left[0 ; \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right], y_{2}=y=$ $=a \\sin ^{3} t, t \\in\\left[\\frac{3 \\pi}{2} ; 2 \\pi\\right]$.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to the calculation of two integrals. The first can be represented as\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nI_{1}=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(y_{1}+a\\right)^{2} d x=\\int_{\\pi / 2}^{0}\\left(a \\sin ^{3} t+a\\right)^{2} d\\left(a \\cos ^{3} t\\right)= \\\\\n=3 a^{2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi / 2}\\left(\\sin ^{3} t+1\\right)^{2} \\cos ^{2} t \\sin t d t\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe second integral, due to the evenness of the cosine and the oddness of the sine, can be brought to the form\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_{2}=\\int_{0}^{a}\\left(y_{2}+a\\right)^{2} d x=\\int_{3 \\pi / 2}^{2 \\pi}\\left(a \\sin ^{3} t+a\\right)^{2} d\\left(a \\cos ^{3} t\\right)= \\\\\n&=3 a^{3} \\int_{0}^{\\pi / 2}\\left(1-\\sin ^{3} t\\right)^{2} \\cos ^{2} t \\sin t d t\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIt was noted above that the desired volume is expressed through the difference of these integrals: $V=2 \\pi\\left(I_{1}-I_{2}\\right)$.

Thus, $I_{1}-I_{2}=3 a^{3} \\int_{0}^{\\pi / 2} \\sin ^{2} 2 t \\sin ^{2} t d t=\\frac{3}{4} a^{3} \\int_{0}^{\\pi / 2}(1-\\cos 4 t)(1-\\cos 2 t) d t=$\n$=\\frac{3}{4} a^{3} \\int_{0}^{\\pi / 2}[1-\\cos 4 t-\\cos 2 t+1 / 2(\\cos 6 t+\\cos 2 t)] d t=\\frac{3}{8} \\pi a^{3}$, since the integrals of the cosines give zero.

Therefore, the equality $y=C x+\\frac{3}{C^{2}}$ gives the general solution of the original equation.\n2) Finding the general solution. Let us set in the original equation, as usual, $y^{\\prime}=t$, and then differentiate the obtained equality with respect to $x$ with the subsequent replacement of $y^{\\prime}$ by $t$:\n\n$$\ny=x t+\\frac{3}{t^{2}}, \\quad y^{\\prime}=t+t^{\\prime} x-\\frac{6 t^{\\prime}}{t^{3}} \\Leftrightarrow t=t+t^{\\prime} x-\\frac{6 t^{\\prime}}{t^{3}}, t^{\\prime}\\left(x-\\frac{6}{t^{3}}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nWe analyze this equality:\n\na) $t^{\\prime}=0 \\Leftrightarrow t=C \\Leftrightarrow y^{\\prime}=C$; we obtain the relation already considered in point 1); it leads to the general solution;\n\nb) $x-\\frac{6}{t^{3}}=0, \\quad x=\\frac{6}{t^{3}}$ (dependence of $x$ on the parameter $t$).\n\nAdding this expression to the dependence of $y$ on $t$, we obtain the parametric solution: $x=\\frac{6}{t^{3}}, \\quad y=x t+\\frac{3}{t^{2}}$.\n\nIncidentally, the given form of the function $\\psi\\left(y^{\\prime}\\right)$ allows us to explicitly express the parameter $t$ in terms of $x$ and thereby obtain the explicit function $y=y(2)$ - the solution of the original equation. Let's do this: $x=\\frac{6}{t^{3}} \\Leftrightarrow t=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{6}{x}}$; substituting into the equality $y=x t+\\frac{3}{t^{2}}$, we get $y=x \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{6}{x}}+3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{x^{2}}{36}}=$ $=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x^{2}}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}(\\sqrt[3]{24}+\\sqrt[3]{3})=\\frac{3 \\sqrt[3]{3 x^{2}}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}$.

You will learn to compute the probabilities of random events (judgments about the results of a random experiment) using the probabilities of so-called elementary outcomes or using formulas that allow finding the probabilities of their combinations. In this process, you will become familiar with one of the most important concepts in probability theory - the concept of independent random events. You will learn to analyze random variables (generalized numerical characteristics of a random experiment), finding their distribution (probabilistic description) or some averaged characteristics, such as the expected value and variance. You will become familiar with the main distributions of random variables: Poisson, Cauchy, Laplace, uniform, normal, exponential, binomial, geometric, and others. You will learn to find the characteristic functions of random variables and from them - the expected value and variance. You will learn to analyze random vectors, finding their distribution or such averaged characteristics as the vector of scatter or the covariance matrix. You will learn to analyze numerical functions of random variables or vectors. Finally, you will learn to compute probabilities related to the sums of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables, using the central limit theorem.\n\nThe package RESHEBNIK.VM will help you perform calculations and provide the necessary reference information. In particular, the package RESHEBNIK.VM can easily compute the values of standard functions often used in solving probabilistic problems.\n\n## 6.1. Classical Probability Model\n\nProblem Statement.

When the number of equally likely elementary outcomes is finite, the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of elementary outcomes favorable to this event to the total number of elementary outcomes.\n\n1. Define the space of elementary outcomes.\n\nThis is characterized by the fact that any realization of the random experiment can be described by one and only one elementary outcome.\n\n2. Verify the equal likelihood of elementary outcomes.\n\nIn solving problems, the equal likelihood of elementary outcomes follows from considerations of symmetry or is assumed to be guaranteed by the methodology of conducting the random experiment.\n\nIn practice, the equal likelihood of elementary outcomes of a random experiment is verified by analyzing its results using mathematical statistics.\n\n3. Select the elementary outcomes that lead to the occurrence of event \\(A\\) (favorable outcomes).\n\nThe criterion for selection is the description of event \\(A\\).\n\n4.

Suppose we have a second-order differential equation\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime \\prime}+p(x) y^{\\prime}+q(x) y=0\n$$\n\nAssume that the coefficients $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ can be represented as series in positive integer powers of $x$, so that equation (1) can be rewritten as\n\n$$\ny^{\\prime \\prime}+\\left(a_{0}+a_{1} x+a_{2} x^{2}+\\ldots\\right) y^{\\prime}+\\left(b_{0}+b_{1} x+b_{2} x^{2}+\\ldots\\right) y=0\n$$\n\nWe will seek the solution of this equation in the form of a power series\n\n$$\ny=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_{k} x^{k}\n$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $y$ and its derivatives into (2), we get\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} k(k-1) c_{k} x^{k-2}+\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k} x^{k} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} k c_{k} x^{k-1}+\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_{k} x^{k} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_{k} x^{k}=0\n$$\n\nMultiplying the power series, collecting like terms, and equating the coefficients of all powers of $x$ in the left-hand side (4) to zero, we obtain a series of equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|l}\nx^{0} & 2 \\cdot 1 c_{2}+a_{0} c_{1}+b_{0} c_{0}=0 \\\\\nx^{1} & 3 \\cdot 2 c_{3}+2 a_{0} c_{2}+a_{1} c_{1}+b_{0} c_{1}+b_{1} c_{0}=0 \\\\\nx^{2} & 4 \\cdot 3 c_{4}+3 a_{0} c_{3}+2 a_{1} c_{2}+a_{2} c_{1}+b_{0} c_{2}+b_{1} c_{1}+b_{2} c_{0}=0 \\\\\n\\ldots & \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nEach subsequent equation (5) contains one more unknown coefficient than the previous one. The coefficients $c_{0}$ and $c_{1}$ remain arbitrary and play the role of arbitrary constants. The first equation (5) gives $c_{2}$, the second gives $c_{3}$, the third gives $c_{4}$, and so on. In general, from the $(k+1)$-th equation, we can determine $c_{k+2}$, knowing $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{k+1}$.\n\nPractically, it is convenient to proceed as follows. We will determine two solutions $y_{1}(x)$ and $y_{2}(x)$ according to the above scheme, choosing $c_{0}=1$ and $c_{1}=0$ for $y_{1}(x)$, and $c_{0}=0$ and $c_{1}=1$ for $y_{2}(x)$, which is equivalent to the following initial conditions:\n\n$$\ny_{1}(0)=1, \\quad y_{1}^{\\prime}(0)=0, \\quad y_{2}(0)=0, \\quad y_{2}^{\\prime}(0)=1\n$$\n\nAny solution of equation (1) will be a linear combination of the solutions $y_{1}(x)$ and $y_{2}(x)$.\n\nIf the initial conditions are of the form $y(0)=A, y^{\\prime}(0)=B$, then obviously,\n\n$$\ny=A y_{1}(x)+B y_{2}(x)\n$$\n\nThe following theorem holds.\n\nTheorem. If the series\n\n$$\np(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k} x^{k} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad q(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_{k} x^{k}\n$$\n\nconverge for $|x|<R$, then the power series (3) constructed by the above method will also converge for these values of $x$ and will be a solution of equation (1).\n\nIn particular, if $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials in $x$, then the series (3) will converge for any value of $x$.",

If the dividend and divisor are simultaneously equal to zero, the quotient, according to the above definition of division (see the previous question), is equal to any number $m$, because $m \\cdot 0 = 0$. Despite this, it sometimes happens that when the dividend and divisor simultaneously become equal to zero, the quotient still has a completely definite value. For example, for $x \\rightarrow 0$, the expression $\\frac{4 x}{x}$, although both the numerator and the denominator become zeros, is equal to 4. Provide more interesting examples and explain the precise meaning of the word \"become.\"",
            "solution": "165. Let the algebraic fraction be $\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}$. For $x=1$, both the numerator and the denominator become zero, and the expression takes the indeterminate form $\\frac{0}{0}$, i.e., it has no definite value. Let's try to circumvent this difficulty in the following way: the numerator and the denominator can be factored into linear factors, so we can write: $\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}=$ $\\frac{(x-1)(x-2)}{(x-1)(x-3)}$ or, by canceling $x-1,=\\frac{x-2}{x-3}$. Let's substitute $x=1$ into this last expression and obtain the value $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the given algebraic fraction has a definite value for $x=1$, namely $\\frac{1}{2}$. However, this method of operation has a significant flaw. We canceled the numerator and the denominator by $x-1$, but this is only permissible when it is known in advance that $x-1$ is not zero (division by zero is not allowed!), i.e., that $x \\neq 1$, whereas we know the opposite: we are precisely looking for the value of the given expression for $x$. Therefore, we had no right to cancel by $x-1$. Let's now approach the question differently. For $x \\neq 1$, we have unconditionally: $\\quad \\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x}=\\frac{x-2}{x-3} . \\quad$ If $\\quad x \\quad$ approaches one infinitely (remaining always different from one), then the value of the expression\n$\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}=\\frac{x-2}{x-3}$ tends to the value $\\frac{1-2}{1-3}=\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus: although for $x=1$ the expression $\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}=\\frac{0}{0}$, i.e., is meaningless, nothing prevents us from agreeing to call the \"value of the fraction $\\frac{x^{2}-3 x+2}{x^{2}-4 x+3}$ at $x=1$ \" the limiting value to which this fraction tends when $x$ approaches one infinitely (becomes one).",

For its construction using a compass and ruler, it is sufficient to construct a segment of length 1. Indeed, having segments 1 and $\\sin x_{0}$, one can construct a segment $\\cos x_{0}$ (using the unit circle), and thus, the angle whose tangent is equal to $\\cos x_{0}$. Let's show how to construct a segment of length 1 (i.e., restore the scale).\n\na) From the point $A=(a, \\sin a)$, where $a \\in\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\alpha\\right)$, lying on the graph of the function, drop a perpendicular to the $O y$ axis (Fig. 113-sol-1). Since $\\sin (\\pi-a)=\\sin a$, this perpendicular will intersect the graph of the function $y=\\sin x$ at the point $B=(\\pi-a, \\sin a)$. Through the midpoint of the segment $A B$, draw a line perpendicular to the $O x$ axis. It will intersect the graph at the point $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 1\\right)$. The segment of this line from the $O x$ axis to the graph of the function $y=\\sin x$ has a length of 1.\n\nb) Here it is somewhat more difficult to construct a segment of unit length.

The circle with center at point $A$ and radius $2 \\sin \\frac{a+b}{2}$ intersects the ray $l$ at point $C$ (Fig. 11-3-sol-2).

A tournament was held in which each wrestler met all the wrestlers from all other villages. Village $A$ is considered stronger than village $B$ if at least $k$ matches between wrestlers from these villages end with a victory for a wrestler from village $A$. It turned out that each village is stronger than the next one in the clockwise direction. What is the maximum value that $k$ can have? (All wrestlers have different strengths, and in a match, the stronger always wins.)\n\n## Solution\n\nEstimate. We will show that such a situation is impossible for $k>290$. We will order the wrestlers in each village by decreasing strength and select the tenth strongest wrestler in each village. We will show that the village where the weakest of the selected wrestlers lives cannot be stronger than the next one. Let's denote the selected wrestlers in our and the next village as $A$ and $B$ respectively. Then, in our village, there are 11 wrestlers who are not stronger than $A$, and in the next village, there are 10 wrestlers who are not weaker than $B$. All 110 matches between these wrestlers will end in favor of the second village, meaning that the number of matches won by wrestlers from our village is no more than $20 \\cdot 20 - 110 = 290$.\n\nExample. Suppose there are 210 novices and 190 masters among the wrestlers (each novice is weaker than any master). We will number the villages counterclockwise. Place the weakest novice and 19 of the weakest masters in the first village; the two weakest remaining novices and 18 of the weakest remaining masters in the second village; the three weakest remaining novices and 17 of the weakest remaining masters in the third village; ...; and the 20 strongest novices in the last village. We will show that the $i$-th village is stronger than the $(i-1)$-th for $i>1$.\n\nIndeed, it has $i$ novices and $20-i$ masters. The masters of the $i$-th village will defeat all in the $(i-1)$-th, and the novices will defeat the novices, and the total number of victories will be $i(i-1) + \\{20(20-i) = i^2 - 21i + 400\\}$. The x-coordinate of the vertex of this parabola is 10.5, so the minimum value at an integer point is achieved at $i=10,11$ and is 290, meaning that the $i$-th village is stronger than the $(i-1)$-th for $k \\leq 290$. Additionally, the masters of the first village will defeat the novices of the 20th village, and the total number of victories will be $20 \\cdot 19 = 380 > 290$, meaning all conditions are met.\n\n## Answer\n\n290.\n\nSubmit a comment",

We will prove the following for the two cases of $\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\left|\\varphi^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}+T\\right)\\right|=\\left|\\varphi^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right| .\n$$\n\nCase 1: $\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\neq \\pi$ times an integer. In this case, since $\\cos \\left[\\varphi\\left(x_{0}+T\\right)\\right]=\\cos \\left[\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right] \\neq \\pm 1$, we have $\\left|\\sin \\left[\\varphi\\left(x_{0}+T\\right)\\right]\\right|=\\left|\\sin \\left[\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right]\\right| \\neq 0$. Therefore, from (1), we get $\\left|\\varphi^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}+T\\right)\\right|=\\left|\\varphi^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right|$.\nCase 2: $\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)=\\pi$ times an integer. In this case, from (3), we know $\\varphi\\left(x_{0}+T\\right)=\\pi$ times an integer.\nSince $\\varphi(x)$ is differentiable at points $x_{0}$ and $x_{0}+T$, i.e., continuous at these points, there exists a neighborhood $\\Delta$ of $x_{0}$ such that for $x \\in \\Delta$,\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\left|\\varphi(x)-\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right|<\\pi . \\\\\n\\left|\\varphi(x+T)-\\varphi\\left(x_{0}+T\\right)\\right|<\\pi .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSince $\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)=\\pi$ times an integer and $\\varphi(x+T)=\\pi$ times an integer, for $x \\in \\Delta$, if $\\varphi(x)=\\pi$ times an integer, then $\\varphi(x)=\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)$ (otherwise, $\\left.|\\varphi(x)-\\varphi(x)| \\geqslant \\pi\\right)$; if $\\varphi(x+T)=\\pi$ times an integer, then\n$$\n\\varphi(x+T)=\\varphi\\left(x_{0}+T\\right) .\n$$\n\nThus, in $\\Delta$, there are only two possibilities:\ni. If there exists a neighborhood $\\Delta$ of $x_{0}$ such that for $x \\in \\Delta$, $\\varphi(x) \\equiv \\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)$, then $\\varphi^{\\prime}\\left(x_{0}\\right)=0$. In this case, since $\\varphi\\left(x_{0}\\right)=\\pi$ times an integer, $\\varphi(x)$ is always $\\pi$ times an integer, and from (1), $\\varphi(x+T)$ is also always $\\pi$ times an integer. Thus, in $\\Delta$, $\\var",

The idea is to take N' > N with b N' > kN' and to ensure that half the indices i with a i \u2264 N' were not included in S. Take S' to be these new indices. Then since S' does not overlap S, the sum over S and S' of 1/a i is at least k + k/2. We then repeat always choosing the new set of indices not to overlap any of the previous sets.

If the vehicle's acceleration never exceeds 6.6 ft/sec 2 , then in particular, its acceleration in the first 20 seconds does not exceed 6.6 ft/sec and hence the velocity curve never gets above the line v = 6.6 t, which cuts the line v = 132 at t = 20. Similarly, if the vehicle's deceleration never exceeds 6.6 ft/sec 2 , then its deceleration in the last 20 seconds never exceeds 6.6 ft/sec, so the velocity curve it never gets above the line v = - 6.6 (t - 60), which represents constant deceleration at the maximum 6.6 ft/sec 2 from t = 40 until the finish at t = 60 when it is stationary. In fact the curve must lie strictly under this line, since the vehicle finishes in less than a minute. Hence the area under the curve, which represents distance travelled, is less than the area of the quadrilateral bounded by t = 0, v = 6.6t, v = 132 and v = -6.6(t - 60), which is 1/2 20. 132 + 20.132 + 1/2 20.132 = 40.132 = 5280 = 1 mile.

We also find that it takes (x 2 - x)/(x 3 - 3x + 1) to (y 2 - y)/(y 3 - 3y + 1). Let I(a, b) = \u222b a b (x 2 - x) 2 /(x 3 - 3x + 1) 2 dx. Then we get I(1/101, 1/11) = \u222b 101/100 11/10 (y 2 - y) 2 /(y 3 - 3y + 1) 2 dy/y 2 . Applying the transformation again gives that I(-100, -10) + I(1/101, 1/11) + I(101/100, 11/10) = \u222b -100 -10 (z 2 - z) 2 /(z 3 - 3z + 1) 2 (1 + (2z 2 - 2z + 1)/( (z - 1) 2 z 2 ) ) dz = \u222b -10 -100 (z 2 - z + 1) 2 /(z 3 - 3z + 1) 2 dz. At this point we are in a difficulty. It is still not obvious how to evaluate the integral explicitly. But at the same time, there is no other obvious approach. If it does have a closed form, then (az 2 + bz + c)/(z 3 - 3z + 1) looks a good candidate. Differentiating this, we find that it does in fact work for a = -1, b = 1, c = 0. So the value is K(-10) - K(-100), where K(z) = (z 2 - z)/(z 3 - 3z + 1). This is obviously rational.

We find that the length for the curve is \u222b 0 2\u03c0 (a 2 + c 2 cos 2 t) 1/2 dt and the length for the ellipse is \u222b 0 2\u03c0 (a 2 + (b 2 - a 2 )cos t ) 1/2 dt.

The ellipse must be able to roll, in other words its maximum radius of curvature must be less than the minimum radius of curvature for the curve. This is another routine calculation, using the expression |(1 + y' 2 ) 3/2 /y''| for the radius of curvature.

This meets the parabola at x 2 + x/2a - a 2 - 1/2 = 0, so the other root is x = -1/2a - a and Q is (-1/2a - a, (a + 1/2a) 2 ). The area under the curve between P and Q is 1/3 (a 3 + (a + 1/2a) 3 ). The area under the chord PQ is (2a + 1/2a) (a 2 + (a + 1/2a) 2 )/2 = 2a 3 + 3a/2 + 1/2a + 1/16a 3 . Hence the area enclosed is 4/3 a 3 + a + 1/4a + 1/48a 3 . We wish to minimise this.

Multiply top and bottom of the integrand in A by (1 - x 2 ) 1/2 , so that we get (1 - x 2 ) on the top. Then note that k 2 (1 - x 2 ) = 1 - k 2 x 2 + (k 2 - 1). For the first half, the part of C 1 enclosed inside C 2 comprises two bent ovals, one at each end. It is tempting to think that when rolled flat, each piece is an ellipse. If that were true, then the problem would be trivial - the semi-axes are r 2 and r 1 sin -1 k, so the total area would be 2\u03c0 r 1 r 2 sin -1 k. But conics only remain conics when projected onto flat surfaces and here we are projecting onto a curved surface. So we have to use integration. Take C 1 to be x 2 + y 2 = r 1 2 , and C 2 to be y 2 + z 2 = r 2 2 . We calculate the area of the quarter of the piece with x > 0 having y, z > 0. We may divide it into strips parallel to the z- axis. Take the angle \u03b8 to be the axial angle - the angle by which the strip has to be rotated about the z- axis from the y = 0 position (keeping in the surface C 1 ). [Points on the strip have the same x and y coordinates, but varying z-coordinates.] The strip has y-coordinate r 1 sin \u03b8 and hence length (r 2 2 - r 1 2 sin 2 \u03b8) 1/2 and width r 1 d\u03b8. Thus the area of the quarter-oval is \u222b 0 sin -1 k (r 2 2 - r 1 2 sin 2 \u03b8) 1/2 r 1 d\u03b8. Put t = 1/k sin \u03b8, and the integral becomes r 2 2 \u222b 0 1 (1 - t 2 ) 1/2 (1 - k 2 t 2 ) -1/2 dt. Hence the complete oval is 4 times this, and the total area 8 times. Comments. The original question was badly worded, because at first sight it appeared to be about volumes, not areas, which may have confused some.

Therefore, $f(x)$ is differentiable, and its derivative is\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=2\\left(s^{\\prime}(x)-\\cos x\\right)(s(x)-\\sin x)+2\\left(c^{\\prime}(x)+\\sin x\\right)(c(x)+\\cos x)\n$$\n\nwhich is indeed 0 according to (1) and (2).\n\nMikl\u00f3s Cs\u00fari (Szeged, S\u00e1gv\u00e1ri E. Gymnasium, 3rd grade)\n\nNote. At the end of our solution, we also showed that if $g(x)$ is differentiable in the interval $a \\leq x \\leq b$, then it is also continuous there, since for any $a \\leq x \\leq b$,\n\n$$\n\\lim _{h \\rightarrow 0} g(x+h)=g(x)+\\lim _{h \\rightarrow 0} h \\cdot \\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}=g(x)\n$$\n\nIt is known that continuous functions in a closed interval take their maximum and minimum values either inside the interval or at its boundaries (high school textbook, 4th grade, p. 89). This implies that if $g(a)=g(b)$, then there exists some $a0$, then $g(x)$ is monotonically increasing in the interval $(a, b)$, and if $g^{\\prime}(x)$ is negative there, then $g(x)$ is monotonically decreasing (see high school textbook, 3rd grade, pp. $270-273$).",

            "solution": "We learned the concept of the inflection point of a curve from the example of the tangent line at the point with the abscissa $x=0$ on the curve of the function $x^{3}$ in the textbook. Here, the tangent itself is the $x$-axis, and as $x$ increases and passes through the value 0, the curve transitions from below the tangent to above it. This can also be stated as follows: considering the ordinates of the points on the curve and the tangent at the inflection point with the same abscissa, their difference is positive when $x<0$. We consider this change in sign a characteristic property of the inflection point and the inflection tangent of any arbitrary function $f(x)$; more precisely: if $[u, f(u)]$ is an inflection point of the curve $y=f(x)$, then taking the tangent at $u$\n\n$$\ny=f(u)+f^{\\prime}(u)(x-u)\n$$\n\nwith the equation, the\n\n$$\nf(x)-\\left[f(u)+f^{\\prime}(u)(x-u)\\right]=g(x)\n$$\n\ndifference changes sign as it passes through $u$ [naturally, the value of the difference $g(u)=0$ at $u$]. - Of course, we are only considering differentiable $f$ functions.\n\nThe change in sign means that the curve of $g(x)$ transitions from below the $x$-axis to above it or from above to below as it passes through $u$. Therefore, this curve rises before and after $u$, or sinks before and after $u$. According to this, since $g$ is differentiable along with $f$ - $g^{\\prime}(x)$ has the same sign after $u$ as it did before $u$.\n\nNow, if in a certain neighborhood of $u$\n\n$$\ng^{\\prime}(x)=f^{\\prime}(x)-f^{\\prime}(u)>0, \\quad x \\neq u\n$$\n\nthis means that whether $x<u$ or $x>u$, the value of the derivative is greater than $f^{\\prime}(u)$, so the derivative has a minimum at $x=u$. Similarly, if in the neighborhood $g^{\\prime}(x)<0$ and $x \\neq u$, then the derivative has a maximum at $u$. Both possibilities require that\n\n$$\n\\left[g^{\\prime}(x)\\right]^{\\prime}=\\left[f^{\\prime}(x)\\right]^{\\prime}=f^{\\prime \\prime}(x)\n$$\n\nthat is, the second derivative of $f$ is 0 at $u$.

If $|x|<1$ and $x \\neq 0$, then $\\left|x^{2}-1\\right|<1$, the variable term is less than 45, and it is equal to 45 at $x=0$, so $f^{\\prime}(x)$ indeed has a strict maximum at $x=0$.\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_644d80e5a93014b26235g-1.jpg?height=550&width=1155&top_left_y=1666&top_left_x=474)\n\nAccording to the above, this is sufficient for the sign change of $g(x)$, so that the points of the curve $f(x)$\n\n$$\n(-1,2), \\quad(0,0), \\quad(1,-2)\n$$\n\nare inflection points.

If the function $x \\mapsto a^{x}$ has a point on the line $y=x$, then this point is also a point on the graph of the function $x \\mapsto \\log _{a} x$, and in this case, the sought distance is zero. Therefore, let's examine the function $f(x)=a^{x}-x$. If the graph of the function $x \\mapsto a^{x}$ has a common point with the line $y=x$, then the set of values of $f(x)$ will include non-positive numbers. The function $f(x)$ is continuous, and $f^{\\prime}(x)=\\left(a^{x}-x\\right)^{\\prime}=a^{x} \\cdot \\ln a-1$ is strictly increasing.

            "problem": "Among the right circular cylinders that can be inscribed in a sphere, for which cylinder will the ratio of the surface area to the volume be the smallest?",
            "solution": "I. solution. Let the radius of the sphere be $R$, the radius of the base circle of the cylinder be $r$, and the height of the cylinder be $h$. Since the center of the cylinder and the sphere coincide, by the Pythagorean theorem, $h=2 \\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}$, and the ratio of the surface area to the volume is\n\n$$\n\\frac{A}{V}=\\frac{2 \\pi r(h+r)}{\\pi r^{2} h}=\\frac{2}{r}+\\frac{2}{h}+\\frac{2}{r}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}}\n$$\n\nApply the weighted harmonic and quadratic mean inequality to the numbers $\\frac{r}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}$ and $\\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}$ with weights $\\sqrt[3]{4}$ and 1:\n\n$$\n(\\sqrt[3]{4}+1) \\frac{V}{A}=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}{\\sqrt[3]{4} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{r}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}}} \\leq \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sqrt[4]{4} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\right)^{2}+{\\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}}^{2}}{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}}=\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}}\n$$\n\nRearranging,\n\n$$\n\\frac{A}{V} \\geq \\frac{(\\sqrt[3]{4}+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{R}\n$$\n\nWe have managed to estimate the ratio of the surface area to the volume from below with a quantity that depends only on the radius of the sphere. Equality holds if and only if the same two numbers were used for the means, i.e., $\\frac{r}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}=\\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}$. Solving for $r$,\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}} R \\quad \\text { and } \\quad h=2 \\sqrt{R^{2}-r^{2}}=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}} R\n$$\n\nIn this case, the ratio of the surface area to the volume is minimal, i.e., $\\frac{(\\sqrt[3]{4}+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{R}$.\n\nII. solution. Let $f(x)=\\frac{2}{x}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R^{2}-x^{2}}}$. According to the previous solution, we need to find the minimum of this function in the interval $(0 ; R)$. We do this by examining the sign of the derivative.\n\n$$\nf^{\\prime}(x)=-\\frac{2}{x^{2}}+\\frac{x}{\\left(R^{2}-x^{2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}=\\frac{x^{3}-2\\left(R^{2}-x^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}}{x^{2}\\left(R^{2}-x^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}}\n$$\n\nIn the interval under consideration, the denominator of the last fraction is always positive, and the numerator is strictly increasing. Its value is 0 when $x^{3}-2\\left(R^{2}-x^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}=0$, i.e., $x=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}} R$.\n\nIn the interval $\\left(0 ; \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}} R\\right)$, $f^{\\prime}<0$, and $f$ is strictly decreasing. In the interval $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}} R ; R\\right)$, $f^{\\prime}>0$, and $f$ is strictly increasing. Therefore, the minimum of the function is at the point $x=\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{2}}{\\sqrt{\\sqrt[3]{4}+1}} R$.\n\nRemark. Among those who solved the problem using derivatives, a common error was that they only looked for the zero of the derivative but did not, or incorrectly justified, why there is a minimum there. It is also not a complete solution if someone only determined that the function has a local minimum at the given point based on the sign of the second derivative.",

We need to prove that \\( f \\) is constant.\n\n2. **Boundedness and the collection \\( \\mathcal{S} \\):**\n   Since \\( f \\) is bounded, there exists a constant \\( M \\) such that \\( |f(z)| \\leq M \\) for all \\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\setminus A \\). Consider the collection \\( \\mathcal{S} \\) of pairs \\( (X, g) \\) where \\( X \\) is an open set such that \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus A \\subset X \\subset \\mathbb{C} \\) and \\( g \\) is an analytic extension of \\( f \\) to \\( X \\) with \\( |g(z)| \\leq M \\) for all \\( z \\in X \\).\n\n3. **Ordering the collection \\( \\mathcal{S} \\):**\n   We order the collection \\( \\mathcal{S} \\) by defining \\( (X_1, g_1) \\leq (X_2, g_2) \\) if \\( X_1 \\subset X_2 \\) and \\( g_1(z) = g_2(z) \\) for all \\( z \\in X_1 \\).\n\n4. **Applying Zorn's Lemma:**\n   If \\( \\{(X_i, g_i)\\} \\) is a chain in \\( \\mathcal{S} \\), then \\( (\\cup_{i} X_i, g) \\) where \\( g(z) = g_i(z) \\) if \\( z \\in X_i \\), is an upper bound of the chain. By Zorn's Lemma, there exists a maximal element \\( (Y, h) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\).\n\n5. **Analyzing the maximal element \\( (Y, h) \\):**\n   Since \\( Y \\) is an open set containing \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus A \\), the set \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) is closed and countable. By Baire's Category Theorem, \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) is either empty or has an isolated point.\n\n6. **Case 1: \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) is empty:**\n   If \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) is empty, then \\( Y = \\mathbb{C} \\). Thus, \\( h \\) is an analytic function on the entire complex plane that is bounded. By Liouville's Theorem, \\( h \\) must be constant. Since \\( h \\) is an extension of \\( f \\), \\( f \\) must also be constant.\n\n7. **Case 2: \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) has an isolated point:**\n   If \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) has an isolated point \\( z_0 \\), we can extend \\( h \\) to \\( z_0 \\) because \\( h \\) is analytic and bounded near \\( z_0 \\). This would contradict the maximality of \\( (Y, h) \\) because we could create a larger pair \\( (Y \\cup \\{z_0\\}, h') \\) where \\( h' \\) extends \\( h \\) to \\( z_0 \\). Therefore, this case cannot occur.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the case where \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) has an isolated point leads to a contradiction, the only possibility is that \\( \\mathbb{C} \\setminus Y \\) is empty.
